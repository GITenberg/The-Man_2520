<h2>FORE-GLIMPSE</h2>
<p>&lsquo;I would rather be an angel than God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The voice of the speaker sounded clearly through the hawthorn 
tree.&nbsp; The young man and the young girl who sat together on 
the low tombstone looked at each other.&nbsp; They had heard the 
voices of the two children talking, but had not noticed what they
said; it was the sentiment, not the sound, which roused their 
attention.</p>
<p>The girl put her finger to her lips to impress silence, and 
the man nodded; they sat as still as mice whilst the two children
went on talking.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The scene would have gladdened a painter&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; 
An old churchyard.&nbsp; The church low and square-towered, with 
long mullioned windows, the yellow-grey stone roughened by age 
and tender-hued with lichens.&nbsp; Round it clustered many 
tombstones tilted in all directions.&nbsp; Behind the church a 
line of gnarled and twisted yews.</p>
<p>The churchyard was full of fine trees.&nbsp; On one side a 
magnificent cedar; on the other a great copper beech.&nbsp; Here 
and there among the tombs and headstones many beautiful 
blossoming trees rose from the long green grass.&nbsp; The 
laburnum glowed in the June afternoon sunlight; the lilac, the 
hawthorn and the clustering meadowsweet which fringed the edge of
the lazy stream mingled their heavy sweetness in sleepy 
fragrance.&nbsp; The yellow-grey crumbling walls were green in 
places with wrinkled harts-tongues, and were topped with 
sweet-williams and spreading house-leek and stone-crop and 
wild-flowers whose delicious sweetness made for the drowsy repose
of perfect summer.</p>
<p>But amid all that mass of glowing colour the two young figures
seated on the grey old tomb stood out conspicuously.&nbsp; The 
man was in conventional hunting-dress: red coat, white stock, 
black hat, white breeches, and top-boots.&nbsp; The girl was one 
of the richest, most glowing, and yet withal daintiest figures 
the eye of man could linger on.&nbsp; She was in riding-habit of 
hunting scarlet cloth; her black hat was tipped forward by 
piled-up masses red-golden hair.&nbsp; Round her neck was a white
lawn scarf in the fashion of a man&rsquo;s hunting-stock, close 
fitting, and sinking into a gold-buttoned waistcoat of snowy 
twill.&nbsp; As she sat with the long skirt across her left arm 
her tiny black top-boots appeared underneath.&nbsp; Her 
gauntleted gloves were of white buckskin; her riding-whip was 
plaited of white leather, topped with ivory and banded with 
gold.</p>
<p>Even in her fourteenth year Miss Stephen Norman gave promise 
of striking beauty; beauty of a rarely composite character.&nbsp;
In her the various elements of her race seemed to have cropped 
out.&nbsp; The firm-set jaw, with chin broader and more square 
than is usual in a woman, and the wide fine forehead and aquiline
nose marked the high descent from Saxon through Norman.&nbsp; The
glorious mass of red hair, of the true flame colour, showed the 
blood of another ancient ancestor of Northern race, and suited 
well with the voluptuous curves of the full, crimson lips.&nbsp; 
The purple-black eyes, the raven eyebrows and eyelashes, and the 
fine curve of the nostrils spoke of the Eastern blood of the 
far-back wife of the Crusader.&nbsp; Already she was tall for her
age, with something of that lankiness which marks the early 
development of a really fine figure.&nbsp; Long-legged, 
long-necked, as straight as a lance, with head poised on the 
proud neck like a lily on its stem.</p>
<p>Stephen Norman certainly gave promise of a splendid 
womanhood.&nbsp; Pride, self-reliance and dominance were marked 
in every feature; in her bearing and in her lightest 
movement.</p>
<p>Her companion, Harold An Wolf, was some five years her senior,
and by means of those five years and certain qualities had long 
stood in the position of her mentor.&nbsp; He was more than six 
feet two in height, deep-chested, broad-shouldered, lean-flanked,
long-armed and big-handed.&nbsp; He had that appearance strength,
with well-poised neck and forward set of the head, which marks 
the successful athlete.</p>
<p>The two sat quiet, listening.&nbsp; Through the quiet hum of 
afternoon came the voices of the two children.&nbsp; Outside the 
lich-gate, under the shade of the spreading cedar, the horses 
stamped occasionally as the flies troubled them.&nbsp; The grooms
were mounted; one held the delicate-limbed white Arab, the other 
the great black horse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would rather be an angel than God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little girl who made the remark was an ideal specimen of 
the village Sunday-school child.&nbsp; Blue-eyed, rosy-cheeked, 
thick-legged, with her straight brown hair tied into a hard bunch
with a much-creased, cherry-coloured ribbon.&nbsp; A glance at 
the girl would have satisfied the most sceptical as to her 
goodness.&nbsp; Without being in any way smug she was radiant 
with self-satisfaction and well-doing.&nbsp; A child of the 
people; an early riser; a help to her mother; a good angel to her
father; a little mother to her brothers and sisters; cleanly in 
mind and body; self-reliant, full of faith, cheerful.</p>
<p>The other little girl was prettier, but of a more stubborn 
type; more passionate, less organised, and infinitely more 
assertive.&nbsp; Black-haired, black-eyed, swarthy, 
large-mouthed, snub-nosed; the very type and essence of 
unrestrained, impulsive, emotional, sensual nature.&nbsp; A 
seeing eye would have noted inevitable danger for the early years
of her womanhood.&nbsp; She seemed amazed by the self-abnegation 
implied by her companion&rsquo;s statement; after a pause she 
replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather be up at the 
top of everything and give orders to the angels if I chose.&nbsp;
I can&rsquo;t think, Marjorie, why you&rsquo;d rather take orders
than give them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s just it, Susan.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want 
to give orders; I&rsquo;d rather obey them.&nbsp; It must be very
terrible to have to think of things so much, that you want 
everything done your own way.&nbsp; And besides, I 
shouldn&rsquo;t like to have to be just!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; the voice was truculent, though there 
was wistfulness in it also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh Susan.&nbsp; Just fancy having to punish; for of 
course justice needs punishing as well as praising.&nbsp; Now an 
angel has such a nice time, helping people and comforting them, 
and bringing sunshine into dark places.&nbsp; Putting down fresh 
dew every morning; making the flowers grow, and bringing babies 
and taking care of them till their mothers find them.&nbsp; Of 
course God is very good and very sweet and very merciful, but oh,
He must be very terrible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the same I would rather be God and able to do 
things!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the children moved off out of earshot.&nbsp; The two 
seated on the tombstone looked after them.&nbsp; The first to 
speak was the girl, who said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s very sweet and good of Marjorie; but do 
you know, Harold, I like Susie&rsquo;s idea better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which idea was that, Stephen?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, didn&rsquo;t you notice what she said: 
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be God and be able to do 
things&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said after a moment&rsquo;s 
reflection.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a fine idea in the 
abstract; but I doubt of its happiness in the 
long-run.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doubt of its happiness?&nbsp; Come now? what could 
there be better, after all?&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it good enough to 
be God?&nbsp; What more do you want?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s tone was quizzical, but her great black eyes 
blazed with some thought of sincerity which lay behind the 
fun.&nbsp; The young man shook his head with a smile of kindly 
tolerance as he answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It isn&rsquo;t that&mdash;surely you must know 
it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m ambitious enough, goodness knows; but there 
are bounds to satisfy even me.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m not sure that 
the good little thing isn&rsquo;t right.&nbsp; She seemed, 
somehow, to hit a bigger truth than she knew: &ldquo;fancy having
to be just.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see much difficulty in that.&nbsp; Anyone
can be just!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;there is perhaps 
nothing so difficult in the whole range of a man&rsquo;s 
work.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was distinct defiance in the 
girl&rsquo;s eyes as she asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man&rsquo;s work!&nbsp; Why a man&rsquo;s work?&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t it a woman&rsquo;s work also?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose it ought to be, theoretically; 
practically it isn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why not, pray?&rsquo;&nbsp; The mere suggestion of 
any disability of woman as such aroused immediate 
antagonism.&nbsp; Her companion suppressed a smile as he answered
deliberately:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, my dear Stephen, the Almighty has ordained 
that justice is not a virtue women can practise.&nbsp; Mind, I do
not say women are unjust.&nbsp; Far from it, where there are no 
interests of those dear to them they can be of a sincerity of 
justice that can make a man&rsquo;s blood run cold.&nbsp; But 
justice in the abstract is not an ordinary virtue: it has to be 
considerate as well as stern, and above all interest of all kinds
and of every one&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; The girl interrupted 
hotly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you at all.&nbsp; You 
can&rsquo;t give an instance where women are unjust.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t mean of course individual instances, but classes of 
cases where injustice is habitual.&rsquo;&nbsp; The suppressed 
smile cropped out now unconsciously round the man&rsquo;s lips in
a way which was intensely aggravating to the girl.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a few,&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Did you ever know a mother just to a boy who beat her own 
boy at school?&rsquo;&nbsp; The girl replied quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ill-treatment and bullying are subjects for punishment,
not justice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean that kind of beating.&nbsp; I 
mean getting the prizes their own boys contended for; getting 
above them in class; showing superior powers in running or 
cricket or swimming, or in any of the forms of effort in which 
boys vie with each other.&rsquo;&nbsp; The girl reflected, then 
she spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, you may be right.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t altogether 
admit it, but I accept it as not on my side.&nbsp; But this is 
only one case.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pretty common one.&nbsp; Do you think that Sheriff of
Galway, who in default of a hangman hanged his son with his own 
hands, would have done so if he had been a woman?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
The girl answered at once:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Frankly, no.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose the mother was
ever born who would do such a thing.&nbsp; But that is not a 
common case, is it?&nbsp; Have you any other?&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
young man paused before he spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is another, but I don&rsquo;t think I can go into
it fairly with you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, because after all you know, Stephen, you are only
a girl and you can&rsquo;t be expected to know.&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
girl laughed:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, if it&rsquo;s anything about women surely a girl,
even of my tender age, must know something more of it, or be able
to guess at, than any young man can.&nbsp; However, say what you 
think and I&rsquo;ll tell you frankly if I agree&mdash;that is if
a woman can be just, in such a matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shortly the point is this: Can a woman be just to 
another woman, or to a man for the matter of that, where either 
her own affection or a fault of the other is 
concerned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see any reason to the contrary.&nbsp; 
Surely pride alone should ensure justice in the former case, and 
the consciousness of superiority in the other.&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
young man shook his head:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pride and the consciousness of superiority!&nbsp; Are 
they not much the same thing.&nbsp; But whether or no, if either 
of them has to be relied on, I&rsquo;m afraid the scales of 
Justice would want regulating, and her sword should be blunted in
case its edge should be turned back on herself.&nbsp; I have an 
idea that although pride might be a guiding principle with you 
individually, it would be a failure with the average.&nbsp; 
However, as it would be in any case a rule subject to many 
exceptions I must let it go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold looked at his watch and rose.&nbsp; Stephen followed 
him; transferring her whip into the hand which held up the skirt,
she took his arm with her right hand in the pretty way in which a
young girl clings to her elders.&nbsp; Together they went out at 
the lich-gate.&nbsp; The groom drew over with the horses.&nbsp; 
Stephen patted hers and gave her a lump of sugar.&nbsp; Then 
putting her foot into Harold&rsquo;s ready hand she sprang 
lightly into the saddle.&nbsp; Harold swung himself into his 
saddle with the dexterity of an accomplished rider.</p>
<p>As the two rode up the road, keeping on the shady side under 
the trees, Stephen said quietly, half to herself, as if the 
sentence had impressed itself on her mind:</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be God and able to do things!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold rode on in silence.&nbsp; The chill of some vague fear 
was upon him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;STEPHEN</h2>
<p>Stephen Norman of Normanstand had remained a bachelor until 
close on middle age, when the fact took hold of him that there 
was no immediate heir to his great estate.&nbsp; Whereupon, with 
his wonted decision, he set about looking for a wife.</p>
<p>He had been a close friend of his next neighbour, Squire 
Rowly, ever since their college days.&nbsp; They had, of course, 
been often in each other&rsquo;s houses, and Rowly&rsquo;s young 
sister&mdash;almost a generation younger than himself, and the 
sole fruit of his father&rsquo;s second marriage&mdash;had been 
like a little sister to him too.&nbsp; She had, in the twenty 
years which had elapsed, grown to be a sweet and beautiful young 
woman.&nbsp; In all the past years, with the constant opportunity
which friendship gave of close companionship, the feeling never 
altered.&nbsp; Squire Norman would have been surprised had he 
been asked to describe Margaret Rowly and found himself compelled
to present the picture of a woman, not a child.</p>
<p>Now, however, when his thoughts went womanward and wifeward, 
he awoke to the fact that Margaret came within the category of 
those he sought.&nbsp; His usual decision ran its course.&nbsp; 
Semi-brotherly feeling gave place to a stronger and perhaps more 
selfish feeling.&nbsp; Before he even knew it, he was head over 
ears in love with his pretty neighbour.</p>
<p>Norman was a fine man, stalwart and handsome; his forty years 
sat so lightly on him that his age never seemed to come into 
question in a woman&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Margaret had always liked
him and trusted him; he was the big brother who had no duty in 
the way of scolding to do.&nbsp; His presence had always been a 
gladness; and the sex of the girl, first unconsciously then 
consciously, answered to the man&rsquo;s overtures, and her 
consent was soon obtained.</p>
<p>When in the fulness of time it was known that an heir was 
expected, Squire Norman took for granted that the child would be 
a boy, and held the idea so tenaciously that his wife, who loved 
him deeply, gave up warning and remonstrance after she had once 
tried to caution him against too fond a hope.&nbsp; She saw how 
bitterly he would be disappointed in case it should prove to be a
girl.&nbsp; He was, however, so fixed on the point that she 
determined to say no more.&nbsp; After all, it might be a boy; 
the chances were equal.&nbsp; The Squire would not listen to any 
one else at all; so as the time went on his idea was more firmly 
fixed than ever.&nbsp; His arrangements were made on the base 
that he would have a son.&nbsp; The name was of course 
decided.&nbsp; Stephen had been the name of all the Squires of 
Normanstand for ages&mdash;as far back as the records went; and 
Stephen the new heir of course would be.</p>
<p>Like all middle-aged men with young wives he was supremely 
anxious as the time drew near.&nbsp; In his anxiety for his wife 
his belief in the son became passive rather than active.&nbsp; 
Indeed, the idea of a son was so deeply fixed in his mind that it
was not disturbed even by his anxiety for the young wife he 
idolised.</p>
<p>When instead of a son a daughter was born, the Doctor and the 
nurse, who knew his views on the subject, held back from the 
mother for a little the knowledge of the sex.&nbsp; Dame Norman 
was so weak that the Doctor feared lest anxiety as to how her 
husband would bear the disappointment, might militate against 
her.&nbsp; Therefore the Doctor sought the Squire in his study, 
and went resolutely at his task.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Squire, I congratulate you on the birth of your 
child!&rsquo;&nbsp; Norman was of course struck with the use of 
the word &lsquo;child&rsquo;; but the cause of his anxiety was 
manifested by his first question:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is she, Doctor?&nbsp; Is she safe?&rsquo;&nbsp; The
child was after all of secondary importance!&nbsp; The Doctor 
breathed more freely; the question had lightened his task.&nbsp; 
There was, therefore, more assurance in his voice as he 
answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is safely through the worst of her trouble, but I 
am greatly anxious yet.&nbsp; She is very weak.&nbsp; I fear 
anything that might upset her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Squire&rsquo;s voice came quick and strong:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be no upset!&nbsp; And now tell me about my 
son?&rsquo;&nbsp; He spoke the last word half with pride, half 
bashfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your son is a daughter!&rsquo;&nbsp; There was silence 
for so long that the Doctor began to be anxious.&nbsp; Squire 
Norman sat quite still; his right hand resting on the 
writing-table before him became clenched so hard that the 
knuckles looked white and the veins red.&nbsp; After a long slow 
breath he spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;She, my daughter, is well?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Doctor 
answered with cheerful alacrity:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Splendid!&mdash;I never saw a finer child in my 
life.&nbsp; She will be a comfort and an honour to 
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Squire spoke again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does her mother think?&nbsp; I suppose she&rsquo;s
very proud of her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does not know yet that it is a girl.&nbsp; I 
thought it better not to let her know till I had told 
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because&mdash;because&mdash;Norman, old friend, you 
know why!&nbsp; Because you had set your heart on a son; and I 
know how it would grieve that sweet young wife and mother to feel
your disappointment.&nbsp; I want your lips to be the first to 
tell her; so that on may assure her of your happiness in that a 
daughter has been born to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Squire put out his great hand and laid it on the 
other&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; There was almost a break in his 
voice as he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, my old friend, my true friend, for your 
thought.&nbsp; When may I see her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By right, not yet.&nbsp; But, as knowing your views, 
she may fret herself till she knows, I think you had better come 
at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All Norman&rsquo;s love and strength combined for his 
task.&nbsp; As he leant over and kissed his young wife there was 
real fervour in his voice as he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is my dear daughter that you may place her in my 
arms?&rsquo;&nbsp; For an instant there came a chill to the 
mother&rsquo;s heart that her hopes had been so far disappointed;
but then came the reaction of her joy that her husband, her 
baby&rsquo;s father, was pleased.&nbsp; There was a heavenly dawn
of red on her pale face as she drew her husband&rsquo;s head down
and kissed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my dear,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I am so happy that
you are pleased!&rsquo;&nbsp; The nurse took the mother&rsquo;s 
hand gently and held it to the baby as she laid it in the 
father&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>He held the mother&rsquo;s hand as he kissed the baby&rsquo;s 
brow.</p>
<p>The Doctor touched him gently on the arm and beckoned him 
away.&nbsp; He went with careful footsteps, looking behind as he 
went.</p>
<p>After dinner he talked with the Doctor on various matters; but
presently he asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose, Doctor, it is no sort of rule that the first
child regulates the sex of a family?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, of course not.&nbsp; Otherwise how should we see 
boys and girls mixed in one family, as is nearly always the 
case.&nbsp; But, my friend,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;you must 
not build hopes so far away.&nbsp; I have to tell you that your 
wife is far from strong.&nbsp; Even now she is not so well as I 
could wish, and there yet may be change.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Squire 
leaped impetuously to his feet as he spoke quickly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why are we waiting here?&nbsp; Can nothing be 
done?&nbsp; Let us have the best help, the best advice in the 
world.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Doctor raised his hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing can be done as yet.&nbsp; I have only 
fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then let us be ready in case your fears should be 
justified!&nbsp; Who are the best men in London to help in such a
case?&rsquo;&nbsp; The Doctor mentioned two names; and within a 
few minutes a mounted messenger was galloping to Norcester, the 
nearest telegraph centre.&nbsp; The messenger was to arrange for 
a special train if necessary.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards the Doctor
went again to see his patient.&nbsp; After a long absence he came
back, pale and agitated.&nbsp; Norman felt his heart sink when he
saw him; a groan broke from him as the Doctor spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is much worse!&nbsp; I am in great fear that she 
may pass away before the morning!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Squire&rsquo;s
strong voice was clouded, with a hoarse veil as he asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I see her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet; at present she is sleeping.&nbsp; She may wake
strengthened; in which case you may see her.&nbsp; But if 
not&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If not?&rsquo;&mdash;the voice was not like his 
own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I shall send for you at once!&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
Doctor returned to his vigil.&nbsp; The Squire, left alone, sank 
on his knees, his face in his hands; his great shoulders shook 
with the intensity of his grief.</p>
<p>An hour or more passed before he heard hurried steps.&nbsp; He
sprang to the door:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You had better come now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is she better?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas! no.&nbsp; I fear her minutes are numbered.&nbsp; 
School yourself, my dear old friend!&nbsp; God will help you in 
this bitter hour.&nbsp; All you can do now is to make her last 
moments happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know!&nbsp; I know!&rsquo; he answered in a voice so 
calm that his companion wondered.</p>
<p>When they came into the room Margaret was dozing.&nbsp; When 
her eyes opened and she found her husband beside her bed there 
spread over her face a glad look; which, alas! soon changed to 
one of pain.&nbsp; She motioned to him to bend down.&nbsp; He 
knelt and put his head beside her on the pillow; his arms went 
tenderly round her as though by his iron devotion and strength he
would shield her from all harm.&nbsp; Her voice came very low and
in broken gasps; she was summoning all her strength that she 
might speak:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, dear husband, I am so sad at leaving 
you!&nbsp; You have made me so happy, and I love you so!&nbsp; 
Forgive me, dear, for the pain I know you will suffer when I am 
gone!&nbsp; And oh, Stephen, I know you will cherish our little 
one&mdash;yours and mine&mdash;when I am gone.&nbsp; She will 
have no mother; you will have to be father and mother 
too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will hold her in my very heart&rsquo;s core, my 
darling, as I hold you!&rsquo;&nbsp; He could hardly speak from 
emotion.&nbsp; She went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And oh, my dear, you will not grieve that she is not a 
son to carry on your name?&rsquo;&nbsp; And then a sudden light 
came into her eyes; and there was exultation in her weak voice as
she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is to be our only one; let her be indeed our 
son!&nbsp; Call her the name we both love!&rsquo;&nbsp; For 
answer he rose and laid his hand very, very tenderly on the babe 
as he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This dear one, my sweet wife, who will carry your soul 
in her breast, will be my son; the only son I shall ever 
have.&nbsp; All my life long I shall, please Almighty God, so 
love her&mdash;our little Stephen&mdash;as you and I love each 
other!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She laid her hand on his so that it touched at once her 
husband and her child.&nbsp; Then she raised the other weak arm, 
and placed it round his neck, and their lips met.&nbsp; Her soul 
went out in this last kiss.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE HEART OF A CHILD</h2>
<p>For some weeks after his wife&rsquo;s death Squire Norman was 
overwhelmed with grief.&nbsp; He made a brave effort, however, to
go through the routine of his life; and succeeded so far that he 
preserved an external appearance of bearing his loss with 
resignation.&nbsp; But within, all was desolation.</p>
<p>Little Stephen had winning ways which sent deep roots into her
father&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; The little bundle of nerves which the
father took into his arms must have realised with all its senses 
that, in all that it saw and heard and touched, there was nothing
but love and help and protection.&nbsp; Gradually the trust was 
followed by expectation.&nbsp; If by some chance the father was 
late in coming to the nursery the child would grow impatient and 
cast persistent, longing glances at the door.&nbsp; When he came 
all was joy.</p>
<p>Time went quickly by, and Norman was only recalled to its 
passing by the growth of his child.&nbsp; Seedtime and harvest, 
the many comings of nature&rsquo;s growth were such commonplaces 
to him, and had been for so many years, that they made on him no 
impressions of comparison.&nbsp; But his baby was one and one 
only.&nbsp; Any change in it was not only in itself a new 
experience, but brought into juxtaposition what is with what 
was.&nbsp; The changes that began to mark the divergence of sex 
were positive shocks to him, for they were unexpected.&nbsp; In 
the very dawn of babyhood dress had no special import; to his 
masculine eyes sex was lost in youth.&nbsp; But, little by 
little, came the tiny changes which convention has 
established.&nbsp; And with each change came to Squire Norman the
growing realisation that his child was a woman.&nbsp; A tiny 
woman, it is true, and requiring more care and protection and 
devotion than a bigger one; but still a woman.&nbsp; The pretty 
little ways, the eager caresses, the graspings and holdings of 
the childish hands, the little roguish smiles and pantings and 
flirtings were all but repetitions in little of the dalliance of 
long ago.&nbsp; The father, after all, reads in the same book in 
which the lover found his knowledge.</p>
<p>At first there was through all his love for his child a 
certain resentment of her sex.&nbsp; His old hope of a son had 
been rooted too deeply to give way easily.&nbsp; But when the 
conviction came, and with it the habit of its acknowledgment, 
there came also a certain resignation, which is the halting-place
for satisfaction.&nbsp; But he never, not then nor afterwards, 
quite lost the old belief that Stephen was indeed a son.&nbsp; 
Could there ever have been a doubt, the remembrance of his 
wife&rsquo;s eyes and of her faint voice, of her hope and her 
faith, as she placed her baby in his arms would have refused it a
resting-place.&nbsp; This belief tinged all his after-life and 
moulded his policy with regard to his girl&rsquo;s 
upbringing.&nbsp; If she was to be indeed his son as well as his 
daughter, she must from the first be accustomed to boyish as well
as to girlish ways.&nbsp; This, in that she was an only child, 
was not a difficult matter to accomplish.&nbsp; Had she had 
brothers and sisters, matters of her sex would soon have found 
their own level.</p>
<p>There was one person who objected strongly to any deviation 
from the conventional rule of a girl&rsquo;s education.&nbsp; 
This was Miss Laetitia Rowly, who took after a time, in so far as
such a place could be taken, that of the child&rsquo;s 
mother.&nbsp; Laetitia Rowly was a young aunt of Squire Rowly of 
Norwood; the younger sister of his father and some sixteen years 
his own senior.&nbsp; When the old Squire&rsquo;s second wife had
died, Laetitia, then a conceded spinster of thirty-six, had taken
possession of the young Margaret.&nbsp; When Margaret had married
Squire Norman, Miss Rowly was well satisfied; for she had known 
Stephen Norman all her life.&nbsp; Though she could have wished a
younger bridegroom for her darling, she knew it would be hard to 
get a better man or one of more suitable station in life.&nbsp; 
Also she knew that Margaret loved him, and the woman who had 
never found the happiness of mutual love in her own life found a 
pleasure in the romance of true love, even when the wooer was 
middle-aged.&nbsp; She had been travelling in the Far East when 
the belated news of Margaret&rsquo;s death came to her.&nbsp; 
When she had arrived home she announced her intention of taking 
care of Margaret&rsquo;s child, just as she had taken care of 
Margaret.&nbsp; For several reasons this could not be done in the
same way.&nbsp; She was not old enough to go and live at 
Normanstand without exciting comment; and the Squire absolutely 
refused to allow that his daughter should live anywhere except in
his own house.&nbsp; Educational supervision, exercised at such 
distance and so intermittently, could neither be complete nor 
exact.</p>
<p>Though Stephen was a sweet child she was a wilful one, and 
very early in life manifested a dominant nature.&nbsp; This was a
secret pleasure to her father, who, never losing sight of his old
idea that she was both son and daughter, took pleasure as well as
pride out of each manifestation of her imperial will.&nbsp; The 
keen instinct of childhood, which reasons in feminine fashion, 
and is therefore doubly effective in a woman-child, early grasped
the possibilities of her own will.&nbsp; She learned the measure 
of her nurse&rsquo;s foot and then of her father&rsquo;s; and so,
knowing where lay the bounds of possibility of the achievement of
her wishes, she at once avoided trouble and learned how to make 
the most of the space within the limit of her tether.</p>
<p>It is not those who &lsquo;cry for the Moon&rsquo; who go 
furthest or get most in this limited world of ours.&nbsp; 
Stephen&rsquo;s pretty ways and unfailing good temper were a 
perpetual joy to her father; and when he found that as a rule her
desires were reasonable, his wish to yield to them became a 
habit.</p>
<p>Miss Rowly seldom saw any individual thing to disapprove 
of.&nbsp; She it was who selected the governesses and who 
interviewed them from time to time as to the child&rsquo;s 
progress.&nbsp; Not often was there any complaint, for the little
thing had such a pretty way of showing affection, and such a 
manifest sense of justified trust in all whom she encountered, 
that it would have been hard to name a specific fault.</p>
<p>But though all went in tears of affectionate regret, and with 
eminently satisfactory emoluments and references, there came an 
irregularly timed succession of governesses.</p>
<p>Stephen&rsquo;s affection for her &lsquo;Auntie&rsquo; was 
never affected by any of the changes.&nbsp; Others might come and
go, but there no change came.&nbsp; The child&rsquo;s little hand
would steal into one of the old lady&rsquo;s strong ones, or 
would clasp a finger and hold it tight.&nbsp; And then the woman 
who had never had a child of her own would feel, afresh each 
time, as though the child&rsquo;s hand was gripping her 
heart.</p>
<p>With her father she was sweetest of all.&nbsp; And as he 
seemed to be pleased when she did anything like a little boy, the
habit of being like one insensibly grew on her.</p>
<p>An only child has certain educational difficulties.&nbsp; The 
true learning is not that which we are taught, but that which we 
take in for ourselves from experience and observation, and 
children&rsquo;s experiences and observation, especially of 
things other than repressive, are mainly of children.&nbsp; The 
little ones teach each other.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters are more
with each other than are ordinary playmates, and in the 
familiarity of their constant intercourse some of the great 
lessons, so useful in after-life, are learned.&nbsp; Little 
Stephen had no means of learning the wisdom of 
give-and-take.&nbsp; To her everything was given, given 
bountifully and gracefully.&nbsp; Graceful acceptance of good 
things came to her naturally, as it does to one who is born to be
a great lady.&nbsp; The children of the farmers in the 
neighbourhood, with whom at times she played, were in such 
habitual awe of the great house, that they were seldom 
sufficiently at ease to play naturally.&nbsp; Children cannot be 
on equal terms on special occasions with a person to whom they 
have been taught to bow or courtesy as a public habit.&nbsp; The 
children of neighbouring landowners, who were few and far 
between, and of the professional people in Norcester, were at 
such times as Stephen met them, generally so much on their good 
behaviour, that the spontaneity of play, through which it is that
sharp corners of individuality are knocked off or worn down, did 
not exist.</p>
<p>And so Stephen learned to read in the Book of Life; though 
only on one side of it.&nbsp; At the age of six she had, though 
surrounded with loving care and instructed by skilled teachers, 
learned only the accepting side of life.&nbsp; Giving of course 
there was in plenty, for the traditions of Normanstand were 
royally benevolent; many a blessing followed the little 
maid&rsquo;s footsteps as she accompanied some timely aid to the 
sick and needy sent from the Squire&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; 
Moreover, her Aunt tried to inculcate certain maxims founded on 
that noble one that it is more blessed to give than to 
receive.&nbsp; But of giving in its true sense: the giving that 
which we want for ourselves, the giving that is as a temple built
on the rock of self-sacrifice, she knew nothing.&nbsp; Her sweet 
and spontaneous nature, which gave its love and sympathy so 
readily, was almost a bar to education: it blinded the eyes that 
would have otherwise seen any defect that wanted altering, any 
evil trait that needed repression, any lagging virtue that 
required encouragement&mdash;or the spur.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III&mdash;HAROLD</h2>
<p>Squire Norman had a clerical friend whose rectory of Carstone 
lay some thirty miles from Normanstand.&nbsp; Thirty miles is not
a great distance for railway travel; but it is a long 
drive.&nbsp; The days had not come, nor were they ever likely to 
come, for the making of a railway between the two places.&nbsp; 
For a good many years the two men had met in renewal of their old
University days.&nbsp; Squire Norman and Dr. An Wolf had been 
chums at Trinity, Cambridge, and the boyish friendship had 
ripened and lasted.&nbsp; When Harold An Wolf had put in his 
novitiate in a teeming Midland manufacturing town, it was 
Norman&rsquo;s influence which obtained the rectorship for his 
friend.&nbsp; It was not often that they could meet, for An 
Wolf&rsquo;s work, which, though not very exacting, had to be 
done single-handed, kept him to his post.&nbsp; Besides, he was a
good scholar and eked out a small income by preparing a few 
pupils for public school.&nbsp; An occasional mid-week visit to 
Normanstand in the slack time of school work on the 
Doctor&rsquo;s part, and now and again a drive by Norman over to 
the rectory, returning the next day, had been for a good many 
years the measure of their meeting.&nbsp; Then An Wolf&rsquo;s 
marriage and the birth of a son had kept him closer to 
home.&nbsp; Mrs. An Wolf had been killed in a railway accident a 
couple of years after her only child had been born; and at the 
time Norman had gone over to render any assistance in his power 
to the afflicted man, and to give him what was under the 
circumstances his best gift, sympathy.&nbsp; After an interval of
a few years the Squire&rsquo;s courtship and marriage, at which 
his old friend had assisted, had confined his activities to a 
narrower circle.&nbsp; The last time they had met was when An 
Wolf had come over to Norcester to aid in the burial of his 
friend&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; In the process of years, however, the 
shadow over Norman&rsquo;s life had begun to soften; when his 
baby had grown to be something of a companion, they met 
again.&nbsp; Norman, &lsquo;who had never since his wife&rsquo;s 
death been able to tear himself, even for a night, away from 
Normanstand and Stephen, wrote to his old friend asking him to 
come to him.&nbsp; An Wolf gladly promised, and for a week of 
growing expectation the Squire looked forward to their 
meeting.&nbsp; Each found the other somewhat changed, in all but 
their old affection.</p>
<p>An Wolf was delighted with the little Stephen.&nbsp; Her 
dainty beauty seemed to charm him; and the child, seeming to 
realise what pleasure she was giving, exercised all her little 
winning ways.&nbsp; The rector, who knew more of children than 
did his, friend, told her as she sat on his knee of a very 
interesting person: his own son.&nbsp; The child listened, 
interested at first, then enraptured.&nbsp; She asked all kinds 
of questions; and the father&rsquo;s eyes brightened as he gladly
answered the pretty sympathetic child, already deep in his heart 
for her father&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; He told her about the boy who 
was so big and strong, and who could run and leap and swim and 
play cricket and football better than any other boy with whom he 
played.&nbsp; When, warmed himself by the keen interest of the 
little girl, and seeing her beautiful black eyes beginning to 
glow, he too woke to the glory of the time; and all the treasured
moments of the father&rsquo;s lonely heart gave out their 
store.&nbsp; And the other father, thrilled with delight because 
of his baby&rsquo;s joy with, underlying all, an added pleasure 
that the little Stephen&rsquo;s interest was in sports that were 
for boys, looked on approvingly, now and again asking questions 
himself in furtherance of the child&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<p>All the afternoon they sat in the garden, close to the stream 
that came out of the rock, and An Wolf told father&rsquo;s tales 
of his only son.&nbsp; Of the great cricket match with Castra 
Puerorum when he had made a hundred not out.&nbsp; Of the school 
races when he had won so many prizes.&nbsp; Of the swimming match
in the Islam River when, after he had won the race and had 
dressed himself, he went into the water in his clothes to help 
some children who had upset a boat.&nbsp; How when Widow 
Norton&rsquo;s only son could not be found, he dived into the 
deep hole of the intake of the milldam of the great Carstone 
mills where Wingate the farrier had been drowned.&nbsp; And how, 
after diving twice without success, he had insisted on going down
the third time though people had tried to hold him back; and how 
he had brought up in his arms the child all white and so near 
death that they had to put him in the ashes of the baker&rsquo;s 
oven before he could be brought back to life.</p>
<p>When her nurse came to take her to bed, she slid down from her
father&rsquo;s knee and coming over to Dr. An Wolf, gravely held 
out her hand and said: &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she 
kissed him and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you so much, Mr. Harold&rsquo;s daddy.&nbsp; 
Won&rsquo;t you come soon again, and tell us more?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Then she jumped again upon her father&rsquo;s knee and hugged him
round the neck and kissed him, and whispered in his ear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Daddy, please make Mr. Harold&rsquo;s daddy when he 
comes again, bring Harold with him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After all it is natural for women to put the essence of the 
letter in the postscript!</p>
<p>Two weeks afterwards Dr. An Wolf came again and brought Harold
with him.&nbsp; The time had gone heavily with little Stephen 
when she knew that Harold was coming with his father.&nbsp; 
Stephen had been all afire to see the big boy whose feats had so 
much interested her, and for a whole week had flooded Mrs. 
Jarrold with questions which she was unable to answer.&nbsp; At 
last the time came and she went out to the hall door with her 
father to welcome the guests.&nbsp; At the top of the great 
granite steps, down which in time of bad weather the white awning
ran, she stood holding her father&rsquo;s hand and waving a 
welcome.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Harold!&nbsp; Good morning, Mr. 
Harold&rsquo;s daddy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The meeting was a great pleasure to both the children, and 
resulted in an immediate friendship.&nbsp; The small girl at once
conceived a great admiration for the big, strong boy nearly twice
her age and more than twice her size.&nbsp; At her time of life 
the convenances are not, and love is a thing to be spoken out at 
once and in the open.&nbsp; Mrs. Jarrold, from the moment she set
eyes on him, liked the big kindly-faced boy who treated her like 
a lady, and who stood awkwardly blushing and silent in the middle
of the nursery listening to the tiny child&rsquo;s proffers of 
affection.&nbsp; For whatever kind of love it is that boys are 
capable of, Harold had fallen into it.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Calf-love&rsquo; is a thing habitually treated with 
contempt.&nbsp; It may be ridiculous; but all the same it is a 
serious reality&mdash;to the calf.</p>
<p>Harold&rsquo;s new-found affection was as deep as his 
nature.&nbsp; An only child who had in his memory nothing of a 
mother&rsquo;s love, his naturally affectionate nature had in his
childish days found no means of expression.&nbsp; A man child can
hardly pour out his full heart to a man, even a father or a 
comrade; and this child had not, in a way, the consolations of 
other children.&nbsp; His father&rsquo;s secondary occupation of 
teaching brought other boys to the house and necessitated a 
domestic routine which had to be exact.&nbsp; There was no place 
for little girls in a boys&rsquo; school; and though many of Dr. 
An Wolf&rsquo;s friends who were mothers made much of the pretty,
quiet boy, and took him to play with their children, he never 
seemed to get really intimate with them.&nbsp; The equality of 
companionship was wanting.&nbsp; Boys he knew, and with them he 
could hold his own and yet be on affectionate terms.&nbsp; But 
girls were strange to him, and in their presence he was 
shy.&nbsp; With this lack of understanding of the other sex, grew
up a sort of awe of it.&nbsp; His opportunities of this kind of 
study were so few that the view never could become rectified.</p>
<p>And so it was that from his boyhood up to his twelfth year, 
Harold&rsquo;s knowledge of girlhood never increased nor did his 
awe diminish.&nbsp; When his father had told him all about his 
visit to Normanstand and of the invitation which had been 
extended to him there came first awe, then doubt, then 
expectation.&nbsp; Between Harold and his father there was love 
and trust and sympathy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The father&rsquo;s married 
love so soon cut short found expression towards his child; and 
between them there had never been even the shadow of a 
cloud.&nbsp; When his father told him how pretty the little 
Stephen was, how dainty, how sweet, he began to picture her in 
his mind&rsquo;s eye and to be bashfully excited over meeting 
her.</p>
<p>His first glimpse of Stephen was, he felt, one that he never 
could forget.&nbsp; She had made up her mind that she would let 
Harold see what she could do.&nbsp; Harold could fly kites and 
swim and play cricket; she could not do any of these, but she 
could ride.&nbsp; Harold should see her pony, and see her riding 
him all by herself.&nbsp; And there would be another pony for 
Harold, a big, big, big one&mdash;she had spoken about its size 
herself to Topham, the stud-groom.&nbsp; She had coaxed her daddy
into promising that after lunch she should take Harold 
riding.&nbsp; To this end she had made ready early.&nbsp; She had
insisted on putting on the red riding habit which Daddy had given
her for her birthday, and now she stood on the top of the steps 
all glorious in hunting pink, with the habit held over her arms, 
with the tiny hunting-hoots all shiny underneath.&nbsp; She had 
no hat on, and her beautiful hair of golden red shone in its 
glory.&nbsp; But even it was almost outshone by the joyous flush 
on her cheeks as she stood waving the little hand that did not 
hold Daddy&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She was certainly a picture to dream 
of!&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s eyes lost nothing of her dainty 
beauty.&nbsp; He was so proud of her that he almost forgot to 
wish that she had been a boy.&nbsp; The pleasure he felt in her 
appearance was increased by the fact that her dress was his own 
idea.</p>
<p>During luncheon Stephen was fairly silent; she usually 
chattered all through as freely as a bird sings.&nbsp; Stephen 
was silent because the occasion was important.&nbsp; Besides, 
Daddy wasn&rsquo;t all alone, and therefore had not to be cheered
up.&nbsp; Also&mdash;this in postscript form&mdash;Harold was 
silent!&nbsp; In her present frame of mind Harold could do no 
wrong, and what Harold did was right.&nbsp; She was unconsciously
learning already a lesson from his presence.</p>
<p>That evening when going to bed she came to say good-night to 
Daddy.&nbsp; After she had kissed him she also kissed &lsquo;old 
Mr. Harold,&rsquo; as she now called him, and as a matter of 
course kissed Harold also.&nbsp; He coloured up at once.&nbsp; It
was the first time a girl had ever kissed him.</p>
<p>The next day from early morning until bed-time was one long 
joy to Stephen, and there were few things of interest that Harold
had not been shown; there were few of the little secrets which 
had not been shared with him as they went about hand in 
hand.&nbsp; Like all manly boys Harold was good to little 
children and patient with them.&nbsp; He was content to follow 
Stephen about and obey all her behests.&nbsp; He had fallen in 
love with her to the very bottom of his boyish heart.</p>
<p>When the guests were going, Stephen stood with her father on 
the steps to see them off.&nbsp; When the carriage had swept 
behind the farthest point in the long avenue, and when 
Harold&rsquo;s cap waving from the window could no longer be 
seen, Squire Norman turned to go in, but paused in obedience to 
the unconscious restraint of Stephen&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; He 
waited patiently till with a long sigh she turned to him and they
went in together.</p>
<p>That night before she went to bed Stephen came and sat on her 
father&rsquo;s knee, and after sundry pattings and kissings 
whispered in his ear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Daddy, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if Harold could come 
here altogether?&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t you ask him to?&nbsp; And 
old Mr. Harold could come too.&nbsp; Oh, I wish he was 
here!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV&mdash;HAROLD AT NORMANSTAND</h2>
<p>Two years afterwards a great blow fell upon Harold.&nbsp; His 
father, who had been suffering from repeated attacks of 
influenza, was, when in the low condition following this, seized 
with pneumonia, to which in a few days he succumbed.&nbsp; Harold
was heart-broken.&nbsp; The affection which had been between him 
and his father had been so consistent that he had never known a 
time when it was not.</p>
<p>When Squire Norman had returned to the house with him after 
the funeral, he sat in silence holding the boy&rsquo;s hand till 
he had wept his heart out.&nbsp; By this time the two were old 
friends, and the boy was not afraid or too shy to break down 
before him.&nbsp; There was sufficient of the love of the old 
generation to begin with trust in the new.</p>
<p>Presently, when the storm was past and Harold had become his 
own man again, Norman said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, Harold, I want you to listen to me.&nbsp; You 
know, my dear boy, that I am your father&rsquo;s oldest friend, 
and right sure I am that he would approve of what I say.&nbsp; 
You must come home with me to live.&nbsp; I know that in his last
hours the great concern of your dear father&rsquo;s heart would 
have been for the future of his boy.&nbsp; And I know, too, that 
it was a comfort to him to feel that you and I are such friends, 
and that the son of my dearest old friend would be as a son to 
me.&nbsp; We have been friends, you and I, a long time, Harold; 
and we have learned to trust, and I hope to love, one 
another.&nbsp; And you and my little Stephen are such friends 
already that your coming into the house will be a joy to us 
all.&nbsp; Why, long ago, when first you came, she said to me the
night you went away: &ldquo;Daddy, wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if 
Harold could come here altogether?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so Harold An Wolf came back with the Squire to 
Normanstand, and from that day on became a member of his house, 
and as a son to him.&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s delight at his coming 
was of course largely qualified by her sympathy with his grief; 
but it would have been hard to give him more comfort than she did
in her own pretty way.&nbsp; Putting her lips to his she kissed 
him, and holding his big hand in both of her little ones, she 
whispered softly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor Harold!&nbsp; You and I should love each other, 
for we have both lost our mother.&nbsp; And now you have lost 
your father.&nbsp; But you must let my dear daddy be yours 
too!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At this time Harold was between fourteen and fifteen years 
old.&nbsp; He was well educated in so far as private teaching 
went.&nbsp; His father had devoted much care to him, so that he 
was well grounded in all the Academic branches of learning.&nbsp;
He was also, for his years, an expert in most manly 
exercises.&nbsp; He could ride anything, shoot straight, fence, 
run, jump or swim with any boy more than his age and size.</p>
<p>In Normanstand his education was continued by the 
rector.&nbsp; The Squire used often to take him with him when he 
went to ride, or fish, or shoot; frankly telling him that as his 
daughter was, as yet, too young to be his companion in these 
matters, he would act as her locum tenens.&nbsp; His living in 
the house and his helping as he did in Stephen&rsquo;s studies 
made familiarity perpetual.&nbsp; He was just enough her senior 
to command her childish obedience; and there were certain 
qualities in his nature which were eminently calculated to win 
and keep the respect of women as well as of men.&nbsp; He was the
very incarnation of sincerity, and had now and again, in certain 
ways, a sublime self-negation which, at times, seemed in 
startling contrast to a manifestly militant nature.&nbsp; When at
school he had often been involved in fights which were nearly 
always on matters of principle, and by a sort of unconscious 
chivalry he was generally found fighting on the weaker 
side.&nbsp; Harold&rsquo;s father had been very proud of his 
ancestry, which was Gothic through the Dutch, as the manifestly 
corrupted prefix of the original name implied, and he had 
gathered from a constant study of the Sagas something of the 
philosophy which lay behind the ideas of the Vikings.</p>
<p>This new stage of Harold&rsquo;s life made for quicker 
development than any which had gone before.&nbsp; Hitherto he had
not the same sense of responsibility.&nbsp; To obey is in itself 
a relief; and as it is an actual consolation to weak natures, so 
it is only a retarding of the strong.&nbsp; Now he had another 
individuality to think of.&nbsp; There was in his own nature a 
vein of anxiety of which the subconsciousness of his own strength
threw up the outcrop.</p>
<p>Little Stephen with the instinct of her sex discovered before 
long this weakness.&nbsp; For it is a weakness when any quality 
can be assailed or used.&nbsp; The using of a man&rsquo;s 
weakness is not always coquetry; but it is something very like 
it.&nbsp; Many a time the little girl, who looked up to and 
admired the big boy who could compel her to anything when he was 
so minded, would, for her own ends, work on his sense of 
responsibility, taking an elfin delight in his discomfiture.</p>
<p>The result of Stephen&rsquo;s harmless little coquetries was 
that Harold had occasionally either to thwart some little plan of
daring, or else cover up its results.&nbsp; In either case her 
confidence in him grew, so that before long he became an 
established fact in her life, a being in whose power and 
discretion and loyalty she had absolute, blind faith.&nbsp; And 
this feeling seemed to grow with her own growth.&nbsp; Indeed at 
one time it came to be more than an ordinary faith.&nbsp; It 
happened thus:</p>
<p>The old Church of St. Stephen, which was the parish church of 
Normanstand, had a peculiar interest for the Norman family.&nbsp;
There, either within the existing walls or those which had 
preceded them when the church was rebuilt by that Sir Stephen who
was standard-bearer to Henry VI., were buried all the direct 
members of the line.&nbsp; It was an unbroken record of the 
inheritors since the first Sir Stephen, who had his place in the 
Domesday Book.&nbsp; Without, in the churchyard close to the 
church, were buried all such of the collaterals as had died 
within hail of Norcester.&nbsp; Some there were of course who, 
having achieved distinction in various walks of life, were 
further honoured by a resting-place within the chancel.&nbsp; The
whole interior was full of records of the family.&nbsp; Squire 
Norman was fond of coming to the place; and often from the very 
beginning had taken Stephen with him.&nbsp; One of her earliest 
recollections was kneeling down with her father, who held her 
hand in his, whilst with the other he wiped the tears from his 
eyes, before a tomb sculptured beautifully in snowy marble.&nbsp;
She never forgot the words he had said to her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will always remember, darling, that your dear 
mother rests in this sacred place.&nbsp; When I am gone, if you 
are ever in any trouble come here.&nbsp; Come alone and open out 
your heart.&nbsp; You need never fear to ask God for help at the 
grave of your mother!&rsquo;&nbsp; The child had been impressed, 
as had been many and many another of her race.&nbsp; For seven 
hundred years each child of the house of Norman had been brought 
alone by either parent and had heard some such words.&nbsp; The 
custom had come to be almost a family ritual, and it never failed
to leave its impress in greater or lesser degree.</p>
<p>Whenever Harold had in the early days paid a visit to 
Normanstand, the church had generally been an objective of their 
excursions.&nbsp; He was always delighted to go.&nbsp; His love 
for his own ancestry made him admire and respect that of others; 
so that Stephen&rsquo;s enthusiasm in the matter was but another 
cord to bind him to her.</p>
<p>In one of their excursions they found the door into the crypt 
open; and nothing would do Stephen but that they should enter 
it.&nbsp; To-day, however, they had no light; but they arranged 
that on the morrow they would bring candles with them and explore
the place thoroughly.&nbsp; The afternoon of the next day saw 
them at the door of the crypt with a candle, which Harold 
proceeded to light.&nbsp; Stephen looked on admiringly, and said 
in a half-conscious way, the half-consciousness being shown in 
the implication:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are not afraid of the crypt?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit!&nbsp; In my father&rsquo;s church there was 
a crypt, and I was in it several times.&rsquo;&nbsp; As he spoke 
the memory of the last time he had been there swept over 
him.&nbsp; He seemed to see again the many lights, held in hands 
that were never still, making a grim gloom where the black 
shadows were not; to hear again the stamp and hurried shuffle of 
the many feet, as the great oak coffin was borne by the 
struggling mass of men down the steep stairway and in through the
narrow door . . . And then the hush when voices faded away; and 
the silence seemed a real thing, as for a while he stood alone 
close to the dead father who had been all in all to him.&nbsp; 
And once again he seemed to feel the recall to the living world 
of sorrow and of light, when his inert hand was taken in the 
strong loving one of Squire Norman.</p>
<p>He paused and drew back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go on?&rsquo; she asked, 
surprised.</p>
<p>He did not like to tell her then.&nbsp; Somehow, it seemed out
of place.&nbsp; He had often spoken to her of his father, and she
had always been a sympathetic listener; but here, at the entrance
of the grim vault, he did not wish to pain her with his own 
thoughts of sorrow and all the terrible memories which the 
similarity of the place evoked.&nbsp; And even whilst he 
hesitated there came to him a thought so laden with pain and fear
that he rejoiced at the pause which gave it to him in time.&nbsp;
It was in that very crypt that Stephen&rsquo;s mother had been 
buried, and had they two gone in, as they had intended, the girl 
might have seen her mother&rsquo;s coffin as he had seen his 
father&rsquo;s, but under circumstances which made him 
shiver.&nbsp; He had been, as he said, often in the crypt at 
Carstone; and well he knew the sordidness of the chamber of 
death.&nbsp; His imagination was alive as well as his memory; he 
shuddered, not for himself, but for Stephen.&nbsp; How could he 
allow the girl to suffer in such a way as she might, as she 
infallibly would, if it were made apparent to her in such a 
brutal way?&nbsp; How pitiful, how meanly pitiful, is the 
aftermath of death.&nbsp; Well he remembered how many a night he 
woke in an agony, thinking of how his father lay in that cold, 
silent, dust-strewn vault, in the silence and the dark, with 
never a ray of light or hope or love!&nbsp; Gone, abandoned, 
forgotten by all, save perhaps one heart which bled . . . He 
would save little Stephen, if he could, from such a memory.&nbsp;
He would not give any reason for refusing to go in.</p>
<p>He blew out the candle, and turned the key in the lock, took 
it out, and put it in his pocket.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, Stephen!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;let us go 
somewhere else.&nbsp; We will not go into the crypt 
to-day!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;&nbsp; The lips that spoke were pouted 
mutinously and the face was flushed.&nbsp; The imperious little 
lady was not at all satisfied to give up the cherished 
project.&nbsp; For a whole day and night she had, whilst waking, 
thought of the coming adventure; the thrill of it was not now to 
be turned to cold disappointment without even an 
explanation.&nbsp; She did not think that Harold was afraid; that
would be ridiculous.&nbsp; But she wondered; and mysteries always
annoyed her.&nbsp; She did not like to be at fault, more 
especially when other people knew.&nbsp; All the pride in her 
revolted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; she repeated more imperiously 
still.</p>
<p>Harold said kindly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, Stephen, there is really a good reason.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t ask me, for I can&rsquo;t tell you.&nbsp; You must 
take it from me that I am right.&nbsp; You know, dear, that I 
wouldn&rsquo;t willingly disappoint you; and I know that you had 
set your heart on this.&nbsp; But indeed, indeed I have a good 
reason.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen was really angry now.&nbsp; She was amenable to 
reason, though she did not consciously know what reason was; but 
to accept some one else&rsquo;s reason blindfold was repugnant to
her nature, even at her then age.&nbsp; She was about to speak 
angrily, but looking up she saw that Harold&rsquo;s mouth was set
with marble firmness.&nbsp; So, after her manner, she acquiesced 
in the inevitable and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right!&nbsp; Harold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But in the inner recesses of her firm-set mind was a distinct 
intention to visit the vault when more favourable circumstances 
would permit.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V&mdash;THE CRYPT</h2>
<p>It was some weeks before Stephen got the chance she 
wanted.&nbsp; She knew it would be difficult to evade 
Harold&rsquo;s observation, for the big boy&rsquo;s acuteness as 
to facts had impressed itself on her.&nbsp; It was strange that 
out of her very trust in Harold came a form of distrust in 
others.&nbsp; In the little matter of evading him she inclined to
any one in whom there was his opposite, in whose reliability she 
instinctively mistrusted.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is nothing bad or 
good but thinking makes it so!&rsquo;&nbsp; To enter that crypt, 
which had seemed so small a matter at first, had now in process 
of thinking and wishing and scheming become a thing to be much 
desired.&nbsp; Harold saw, or rather felt, that something was in 
the girl&rsquo;s mind, and took for granted that it had something
to do with the crypt.&nbsp; But he thought it better not to say 
anything lest he should keep awake a desire which he hoped would 
die naturally.</p>
<p>One day it was arranged that Harold should go over to Carstone
to see the solicitor who had wound up his father&rsquo;s 
business.&nbsp; He was to stay the night and ride back next 
day.&nbsp; Stephen, on hearing of the arrangement, so contrived 
matters that Master Everard, the son of a banker who had recently
purchased an estate in the neighbourhood, was asked to come to 
play with her on the day when Harold left.&nbsp; It was holiday 
time at Eton, and he was at home.&nbsp; Stephen did not mention 
to Harold the fact of his coming; it was only from a chance 
allusion of Mrs. Jarrold before he went that he inferred 
it.&nbsp; He did not think the matter of sufficient importance to
wonder why Stephen, who generally told him everything, had not 
mentioned this.</p>
<p>During their play, Stephen, after pledging him to secrecy, 
told Leonard of her intention of visiting the crypt, and asked 
him to help her in it.&nbsp; This was an adventure, and as such 
commended itself to the schoolboy heart.&nbsp; He entered at once
into the scheme con amore; and the two discussed ways and 
means.&nbsp; Leonard&rsquo;s only regret was that he was 
associated with a little girl in such a project.&nbsp; It was 
something of a blow to his personal vanity, which was a large 
item in his moral equipment, that such a project should have been
initiated by the girl and not by himself.&nbsp; He was to get 
possession of the key and in the forenoon of the next day he was 
to be waiting in the churchyard, when Stephen would join him as 
soon as she could evade her nurse.&nbsp; She was now more than 
eleven, and had less need of being watched than in her earlier 
years.&nbsp; It was possible, with strategy, to get away 
undiscovered for an hour.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>At Carstone Harold got though what he had to do that same 
afternoon and arranged to start early in the morning for 
Normanstand.&nbsp; After an early breakfast he set out on his 
thirty-mile journey at eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Littlejohn, his
horse, was in excellent form, notwithstanding his long journey of
the day before, and with his nose pointed for home, put his best 
foot foremost.&nbsp; Harold felt in great spirits.&nbsp; The long
ride the day before had braced him physically, though there were 
on his journey times of great sadness when the thought of his 
father came back to him and the sense of loss was renewed with 
each thought of his old home.&nbsp; But youth is naturally 
buoyant.&nbsp; His visit to the church, the first thing on his 
arrival at Carstone, and his kneeling before the stone made 
sacred to his father&rsquo;s memory, though it entailed a silent 
gush of tears, did him good, and even seemed to place his sorrow 
farther away.&nbsp; When he came again in the morning before 
leaving Carstone there were no tears.&nbsp; There was only a holy
memory which seemed to sanctify loss; and his father seemed 
nearer to him than ever.</p>
<p>As he drew near Normanstand he looked forward eagerly to 
seeing Stephen, and the sight of the old church lying far below 
him as he came down the steep road over Alt Hill, which was the 
short-cut from Norcester, set his mind working.&nbsp; His visit 
to the tomb of his own father made him think of the day when he 
kept Stephen from entering the crypt.</p>
<p>The keenest thought is not always conscious.&nbsp; It was 
without definite intention that when he came to the bridle-path 
Harold turned his horse&rsquo;s head and rode down to the 
churchyard.&nbsp; As he pushed open the door of the church he 
half expected to see Stephen; and there was a vague possibility 
that Leonard Everard might be with her.</p>
<p>The church was cool and dim.&nbsp; Coming from the hot glare 
the August sunshine it seemed, at the first glance, dark.&nbsp; 
He looked around, and a sense of relief came over him.&nbsp; The 
place was empty.</p>
<p>But even as he stood, there came a sound which made his heart 
grow cold.&nbsp; A cry, muffled, far away and full of anguish; a 
sobbing cry, which suddenly ceased.</p>
<p>It was the voice of Stephen.&nbsp; He instinctively knew where
it came from; the crypt.&nbsp; Only for the experience he had had
of her desire to enter the place, he would never have suspected 
that it was so close to him.&nbsp; He ran towards the corner 
where commenced the steps leading downward.&nbsp; As he reached 
the spot a figure came rushing up the steps.&nbsp; A boy in Eton 
jacket and wide collar, careless, pale, and agitated.&nbsp; It 
was Leonard Everard.&nbsp; Harold seized him as he came.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is Stephen?&rsquo; he cried in a quick, low 
voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the vault below there.&nbsp; She dropped her light 
and then took mine, and she dropped it too.&nbsp; Let me 
go!&nbsp; Let me go!&rsquo;&nbsp; He struggled to get away; but 
Harold held him tight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where are the matches?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In my pocket.&nbsp; Let me go!&nbsp; Let me 
go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me them&mdash;this instant!&rsquo;&nbsp; He was 
examining the frightened boy&rsquo;s waistcoat pockets as he 
spoke.&nbsp; When he had got the matches he let the boy go, and 
ran down the steps and through the open door into the crypt, 
calling out as he came:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stephen!&nbsp; Stephen dear, where are you?&nbsp; It is
I&mdash;Harold!&rsquo;&nbsp; There was no response; his heart 
seemed to grow cold and his knees to weaken.&nbsp; The match 
spluttered and flashed, and in the momentary glare he saw across 
the vault, which was not a large place, a white mass on the 
ground.&nbsp; He had to go carefully, lest the match should be 
blown out by the wind of his passage; but on coming close he saw 
that it was Stephen lying senseless in front of a great coffin 
which rested on a built-out pile of masonry.&nbsp; Then the match
went out.&nbsp; In the flare of the next one he lit he saw a 
piece of candle lying on top of the coffin.&nbsp; He seized and 
lit it.&nbsp; He was able to think coolly despite his agitation, 
and knew that light was the first necessity.&nbsp; The bruised 
wick was slow to catch; he had to light another match, his last 
one, before it flamed.&nbsp; The couple of seconds that the light
went down till the grease melted and the flame leaped again 
seemed of considerable length.&nbsp; When the lit candle was 
placed steadily on top of the coffin, and a light, dim, though 
strong enough to see with, spread around, he stooped and lifted 
Stephen in his arms.&nbsp; She was quite senseless, and so limp 
that a great fear came upon him that she might be dead.&nbsp; He 
did not waste time, but carried her across the vault where the 
door to the church steps stood out sharp against the darkness, 
and bore her up into the church.&nbsp; Holding her in one arm, 
with the other hand he dragged some long cushions from one of the
pews and spread them on the floor; on these he laid her.&nbsp; 
His heart was smitten with love and pity as he looked.&nbsp; She 
was so helpless; so pitifully helpless!&nbsp; Her arms and legs 
were doubled up as though broken, disjointed; the white frock was
smeared with patches of thick dust.&nbsp; Instinctively he 
stooped and pulled the frock down and straightened out the arms 
and feet.&nbsp; He knelt beside her, and felt if her heart was 
still beating, a great fear over him, a sick apprehension.&nbsp; 
A gush of thankful prayer came from his heart.&nbsp; Thank God! 
she was alive; he could feel her heart beat, though faintly 
underneath his hand.&nbsp; He started to his feet and ran towards
the door, seizing his hat, which lay on a seat.&nbsp; He wanted 
it to bring back some water.&nbsp; As he passed out of the door 
he saw Leonard a little distance off, but took no notice of 
him.&nbsp; He ran to the stream, filled his hat with water, and 
brought it back.&nbsp; When he came into the church he saw 
Stephen, already partially restored, sitting up on the cushions 
with Leonard supporting her.</p>
<p>He was rejoiced; but somehow disappointed.&nbsp; He would 
rather Leonard had not been there.&nbsp; He remembered&mdash;he 
could not forget&mdash;the white face of the boy who fled out of 
the crypt leaving Stephen in a faint within, and who had lingered
outside the church door whilst he ran for water.&nbsp; Harold 
came forward quickly and raised Stephen, intending to bring her 
into the fresh air.&nbsp; He had a shrewd idea that the sight of 
the sky and God&rsquo;s greenery would be the best medicine for 
her after her fright.&nbsp; He lifted her in his strong arms as 
he used to do when she was a very little child and had got tired 
in their walks together; and carried her to the door.&nbsp; She 
lent herself unconsciously to the movement, holding fast with her
arm round his neck as she used to do.&nbsp; In her clinging was 
the expression of her trust in him.&nbsp; The little sigh with 
which she laid her head on his shoulder was the tribute to his 
masculine power, and her belief in it.&nbsp; Every instant her 
senses were coming back to her more and more.&nbsp; The veil of 
oblivion was passing from her half-closed eyes, as the tide of 
full remembrance swept in upon her.&nbsp; Her inner nature was 
expressed in the sequence of her emotions.&nbsp; Her first 
feeling was one of her own fault.&nbsp; The sight of Harold and 
his proximity recalled to her vividly how he had refused to go 
into the crypt, and how she had intentionally deceived him, 
negatively, as to her intention of doing that of which he 
disapproved.&nbsp; Her second feeling was one of justice; and was
perhaps partially evoked by the sight of Leonard, who followed 
close as Harold brought her to the door.&nbsp; She did not wish 
to speak of herself or Harold before him; but she did not 
hesitate to speak of him to Harold:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must not blame Leonard.&nbsp; It was all my 
fault.&nbsp; I made him come!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her generosity 
appealed to Harold.&nbsp; He was angry with the boy for being 
there at all; but more for his desertion of the girl in her 
trouble.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not blaming him for being with you!&rsquo; he
said simply.&nbsp; Leonard spoke at once.&nbsp; He had been 
waiting to defend himself, for that was what first concerned that
young gentleman; next to his pleasure, his safety most appealed 
to him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I went to get help.&nbsp; You had let the candle drop; 
and how could I see in the dark?&nbsp; You would insist on 
looking at the plate on the coffin!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A low moan broke from Stephen, a long, low, trembling moan 
which went to Harold&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Her head drooped over 
again on his shoulder; and she clung close to him as the memory 
of her shock came back to her.&nbsp; Harold spoke to Leonard over
his shoulder in a low, fierce whisper, which Stephen did not seem
to hear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There! that will do.&nbsp; Go away!&nbsp; You have done
enough already.&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; Go!&rsquo; he added more sternly,
as the boy seemed disposed to argue.&nbsp; Leonard ran a few 
steps, then walked to the lich-gate, where he waited.</p>
<p>Stephen clung close to Harold in a state of agitation which 
was almost hysterical.&nbsp; She buried her face in his shoulder,
sobbing brokenly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Harold!&nbsp; It was too awful.&nbsp; I never 
thought, never for a moment, that my poor dear mother was buried 
in the crypt.&nbsp; And when I went to look at the name on the 
coffin that was nearest to where I was, I knocked away the dust, 
and then I saw her name: &ldquo;Margaret Norman, aetat 
22.&rdquo;&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t bear it.&nbsp; She was only a 
girl herself, only just twice my age&mdash;lying there in that 
terrible dark place with all the thick dust and the 
spiders&rsquo; webs.&nbsp; Oh, Harold, Harold!&nbsp; How shall I 
ever bear to think of her lying there, and that I shall never see
her dear face?&nbsp; Never!&nbsp; Never!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He tried to soothe her by patting and holding her hands.&nbsp;
For a good while the resolution of the girl faltered, and she was
but as a little child.&nbsp; Then her habitual strength of mind 
asserted itself.&nbsp; She did not ask Harold how she came to be 
out in the church instead of in the crypt when she recovered her 
senses.&nbsp; She seemed to take it for granted that Leonard had 
carried her out; and when she said how brave it had been of him, 
Harold, with his customary generosity, allowed her to preserve 
the belief.&nbsp; When they had made their way to the gate 
Leonard came up to them; but before he could speak Stephen had 
begun to thank him.&nbsp; He allowed her to do so, though the 
sight of Harold&rsquo;s mouth set in scorn, and his commanding 
eyes firmly fixed on him, made him grow hot and cold 
alternately.&nbsp; He withdrew without speaking; and took his way
home with a heart full of bitterness and revengeful feelings.</p>
<p>In the park Stephen tried to dust herself, and then Harold 
tried to assist her.&nbsp; But her white dress was incurably 
soiled, the fine dust of the vault seemed to have got ingrained 
in the muslin.&nbsp; When she got to the house she stole 
upstairs, so that no one might notice her till she had made 
herself tidy.</p>
<p>The next day but one she took Harold for a walk in the 
afternoon.&nbsp; When they were quite alone and out of earshot 
she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been thinking all night about poor mother.&nbsp;
Of course I know she cannot be moved from the crypt.&nbsp; She 
must remain there.&nbsp; But there needn&rsquo;t be all that 
dust.&nbsp; I want you to come there with me some time 
soon.&nbsp; I fear I am afraid to go alone.&nbsp; I want to bring
some flowers and to tidy up the place.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you come
with me this time?&nbsp; I know now, Harold, why you didn&rsquo;t
let me go in before.&nbsp; But now it is different.&nbsp; This is
not curiosity.&nbsp; It is Duty and Love.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you 
come with me, Harold?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold leaped from the edge of the ha-ha where he had been 
sitting and held up his hand.&nbsp; She took it and leaped down 
lightly beside him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;let us go there 
now!&rsquo;&nbsp; She took his arm when they got on the path 
again, and clinging to him in her pretty girlish way they went 
together to the piece of garden which she called her own; there 
they picked a great bunch of beautiful white flowers.&nbsp; Then 
they walked to the old church.&nbsp; The door was open and they 
passed in.&nbsp; Harold took from his pocket a tiny key.&nbsp; 
This surprised her, and heightened the agitation which she 
naturally suffered from revisiting the place.&nbsp; She said 
nothing whilst he opened the door to the crypt.&nbsp; Within, on 
a bracket, stood some candles in glass shades and boxes of 
matches.&nbsp; Harold lit three candles, and leaving one of them 
on the shelf, and placing his cap beside it, took the other two 
in his hands.&nbsp; Stephen, holding her flowers tightly to her 
breast with her right hand, took Harold&rsquo;s arm with the 
left, and with beating heart entered the crypt.</p>
<p>For several minutes Harold kept her engaged, telling her about
the crypt in his father&rsquo;s church, and how he went down at 
his last visit to see the coffin of his dear father, and how he 
knelt before it.&nbsp; Stephen was much moved, and held tight to 
his arm, her heart beating.&nbsp; But in the time she was getting
accustomed to the place.&nbsp; Her eyes, useless at first on 
coming out of the bright sunlight, and not able to distinguish 
anything, began to take in the shape of the place and to see the 
rows of great coffins that stood out along the far wall.&nbsp; 
She also saw with surprise that the newest coffin, on which for 
several reasons her eyes rested, was no longer dusty but was 
scrupulously clean.&nbsp; Following with her eyes as well as she 
could see into the further corners she saw that there the same 
reform had been effected.&nbsp; Even the walls and ceiling had 
been swept of the hanging cobwebs, and the floor was clean with 
the cleanliness of ablution.&nbsp; Still holding Harold&rsquo;s 
arm, she moved over towards her mother&rsquo;s coffin and knelt 
before it.&nbsp; Harold knelt with her; for a little while she 
remained still and silent, praying inwardly.&nbsp; Then she rose,
and taking her great bunch of flowers placed them lovingly on the
lid of the coffin above where she thought her mother&rsquo;s 
heart would be.&nbsp; Then she turned to Harold, her eyes flowing
and her cheeks wet with tears, and laid her head against his 
breast.&nbsp; Her arms could not go round his neck till he had 
bent his head, for with his great height he simply towered above 
her.&nbsp; Presently she was quiet; the paroxysm of her grief had
passed.&nbsp; She took Harold&rsquo;s hand in both hers, and 
together they went to the door.&nbsp; With his disengaged hand, 
for he would not have disturbed the other for worlds, Harold put 
out the lights and locked the door behind them.</p>
<p>In the church she held him away from her, and looked him 
fairly in the face.&nbsp; She said slowly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harold, was it you who had the crypt 
cleaned?&rsquo;&nbsp; He answered in a low voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew you would want to go again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She took the great hand which she held between hers, and 
before he knew what she was doing and could prevent her, raised 
it to her lips and kissed it, saying lovingly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Harold!&nbsp; No brother in all the wide world 
could be kinder.&nbsp; And&mdash;and&mdash;&rsquo; this with a 
sob, &lsquo;we both thank you; mother and I!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI&mdash;A VISIT TO OXFORD</h2>
<p>The next important move in the household was Harold&rsquo;s 
going to Cambridge.&nbsp; His father had always intended this, 
and Squire Norman had borne his wishes in mind.&nbsp; Harold 
joined Trinity, the college which had been his father&rsquo;s, 
and took up his residence in due course.</p>
<p>Stephen was now nearly twelve.&nbsp; Her range of friendships,
naturally limited by her circumstances in life, was enlarged to 
the full; and if she had not many close friends there were at 
least of them all that was numerically possible.&nbsp; She still 
kept up to certain degree the little gatherings which in her 
childhood were got together for her amusement, and in the various
games then instituted she still took a part.&nbsp; She never lost
sight of the fact that her father took a certain pleasure in her 
bodily vigour.&nbsp; And though with her growing years and the 
conscious acceptance of her womanhood, she lost sight of the old 
childish fancy of being a boy instead of a girl, she could not 
lose sight of the fact that strength and alertness are sources of
feminine as well as of masculine power.</p>
<p>Amongst the young friends who came from time to time during 
his holidays was Leonard Everard, now a tall, handsome boy.&nbsp;
He was one of those boys who develop young, and who seem never to
have any of that gawky stage so noticeable in the youth of men 
made in a large pattern.&nbsp; He was always well-poised, 
trim-set, alert; fleet of foot, and springy all over.&nbsp; In 
games he was <i>facile princeps</i>, seeming to make his effort 
always in the right way and without exertion, as if by an 
instinct of physical masterdom.&nbsp; His universal success in 
such matters helped to give him an easy debonair manner which was
in itself winning.&nbsp; So physically complete a youth has 
always a charm.&nbsp; In its very presence there is a sort of 
sympathetic expression, such as comes with the sunshine.</p>
<p>Stephen always in Leonard&rsquo;s presence showed something of
the common attitude.&nbsp; His youth and beauty and sex all had 
their influence on her.&nbsp; The influence of sex, as it is 
understood with regard to a later period of life, did not in her 
case exist; Cupid&rsquo;s darts are barbed and winged for more 
adult victims.&nbsp; But in her case Leonard&rsquo;s masculine 
superiority, emphasised by the few years between their age, his 
sublime self-belief, and, above all, his absolute disregard for 
herself or her wishes or her feelings, put him on a level at 
which she had to look up to him.&nbsp; The first step in the 
ladder of pre-eminence had been achieved when she realised that 
he was not on her level; the second when she experienced rather 
than thought that he had more influence on her than she had on 
him.&nbsp; Here again was a little morsel of hero worship, which,
though based on a misconception of fact, was still of 
influence.&nbsp; In that episode of the crypt she had always 
believed that it was Leonard who had carried her out and laid her
on the church floor in light and safety.&nbsp; He had been strong
enough and resolute enough to do this, whilst she had 
fainted!&nbsp; Harold&rsquo;s generous forbearance had really 
worked to a false end.</p>
<p>It was not strange, therefore, that she found occasional 
companionship with the handsome, wilful, domineering boy somewhat
of luxury.&nbsp; She did not see him often enough to get tired of
him; to find out the weakness of his character; to realise his 
deep-seated, remorseless selfishness.&nbsp; But after all he was 
only an episode in a young life which was full of 
interests.&nbsp; Term after term came and went; the holidays had 
their seasonable pleasures, occasionally shared in common.&nbsp; 
That was all.</p>
<p>Harold&rsquo;s attitude was the same as ever.&nbsp; He was of 
a constant nature; and now that manhood was within hail the love 
of his boyhood was ripening to a man&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; That was
all.&nbsp; He was with regard to Stephen the same devoted, 
worshipping protector, without thought of self; without hope of 
reward.&nbsp; Whatever Stephen wished Harold did; and Stephen, 
knowing their old wishes and their old pleasures, was content 
with their renewal.&nbsp; Each holiday between the terms became 
mainly a repetition of the days of the old life.&nbsp; They lived
in the past.</p>
<p>Amongst the things that did not change was Stephen&rsquo;s 
riding dress.&nbsp; The scarlet habit had never been a thing for 
everyday wear, but had from the first been kept for special 
occasions.&nbsp; Stephen herself knew that it was not a 
conventional costume; but she rather preferred it, if on that 
account alone.&nbsp; In a certain way she felt justified in using
it; for a red habit was a sort of tradition in the family.</p>
<p>It was on one of these occasions that she had gone with Harold
into the churchyard where they had heard the discussion regarding
God and the Angels.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When Stephen was about sixteen she went for a short visit to 
Oxford.&nbsp; She stayed at Somerville with Mrs. Egerton, an old 
friend of her mother&rsquo;s, who was a professor at the 
college.&nbsp; She sent back her maid who had travelled with her,
as she knew that the college girls did not have servants of their
own.&nbsp; The visit was prolonged by mutual consent into a 
duration of some weeks.&nbsp; Stephen fell in love with the place
and the life, and had serious thoughts of joining the college 
herself.&nbsp; Indeed she had made up her mind to ask her father 
to allow her, knowing well that he would consent to that or to 
any other wholesome wish of hers.&nbsp; But then came the thought
that he would be all alone at home; and following that came 
another thought, and one of more poignant feeling.&nbsp; He was 
alone now!&nbsp; Already, for many days, she had left him, for 
the first time in her life!&nbsp; Stephen was quick to act; well 
she knew that at home there would be no fault found with her for 
a speedy return.&nbsp; Within a few hours she had brought her 
visit to an end, and was by herself, despite Mrs. Egerton&rsquo;s
protest, in the train on the way back to Norcester.</p>
<p>In the train she began to review, for the first time, her 
visit to the university.&nbsp; All had been so strange and new 
and delightful to her that she had never stopped for 
retrospect.&nbsp; Life in the new and enchanting place had been 
in the moving present.&nbsp; The mind had been receptive only, 
gathering data for later thought.&nbsp; During her visit she had 
had no one to direct her thought, and so it had been all 
personal, with the freedom of individuality at large.&nbsp; Of 
course her mother&rsquo;s friend, skilled in the mind-workings of
average girls, and able to pick her way through intellectual and 
moral quagmires, had taken good care to point out to her certain 
intellectual movements and certain moral lessons; just as she had
in their various walks and drives pointed out matters of 
interest&mdash;architectural beauties and spots of historic 
import.&nbsp; And she had taken in, loyally accepted, and 
thoroughly assimilated all that she had been told.&nbsp; But 
there were other lessons which were for her young eyes; facts 
which the older eyes had ceased to notice, if they had ever 
noticed them at all.&nbsp; The self-content, the sex-content in 
the endless tide of young men that thronged the streets and quads
and parks; the all-sufficing nature of sport or study, to 
whichever their inclinations tended.&nbsp; The small part which 
womankind seemed to have in their lives.&nbsp; Stephen had had, 
as we know, a peculiar training; whatever her instincts were, her
habits were largely boy habits.&nbsp; Here she was amongst boys, 
a glorious tide of them; it made now and again her heart beat to 
look at them.&nbsp; And yet amongst them all she was only an 
outsider.&nbsp; She could not do anything better than any of 
them.&nbsp; Of course, each time she went out, she became 
conscious of admiring glances; she could not be woman without 
such consciousness.&nbsp; But it was as a girl that men looked at
her, not as an equal.&nbsp; As well as personal experience and 
the lessons of eyes and ears and intelligence, there were other 
things to classify and adjust; things which were entirely from 
the outside of her own life.&nbsp; The fragments of common-room 
gossip, which it had been her fortune to hear accidentally now 
and again.&nbsp; The half confidences of scandals, borne on 
whispered breaths.&nbsp; The whole confidences of dormitory and 
study which she had been privileged to share.&nbsp; All were 
parts of the new and strange world, the great world which had 
swum into her ken.</p>
<p>As she sat now in the train, with some formulation of memory 
already accomplished in the two hours of solitude, her first 
comment, spoken half audibly, would have surprised her teachers 
as much as it would have surprised herself, if she had been 
conscious of it; for as yet her thinking was not 
self-conscious:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely, I am not like that!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was of the women she had been thinking, not of the 
men.&nbsp; The glimpse which she had had of her own sex had been 
an awakening to her; and the awakening had not been to a pleasant
world.&nbsp; All at once she seemed to realise that her sex had 
defects&mdash;littlenesses, meannesses, cowardices, 
falsenesses.&nbsp; That their occupations were apt to be trivial 
or narrow or selfish; that their desires were earthly, and their 
tastes coarse; that what she held to be goodness was apt to be 
realised only as fear.&nbsp; That innocence was but ignorance, or
at least baffled curiosity.&nbsp; That . . .</p>
<p>A flood of shame swept over her, and instinctively she put her
hands before her burning face.&nbsp; As usual, she was running 
all at once into extremes.</p>
<p>And above all these was borne upon her, and for the first time
in her life, that she was herself a woman!</p>
<p>For a long time she sat quite still.&nbsp; The train thrilled 
and roared on its way.&nbsp; Crowded stations took and gave their
quantum of living freight; but the young girl sat abstracted, 
unmoved, seemingly unconscious.&nbsp; All the dominance and 
energy of her nature were at work.</p>
<p>If, indeed, she was a woman, and had to abide by the 
exigencies of her own sex, she would at least not be ruled and 
limited by woman&rsquo;s weakness.&nbsp; She would plan and act 
and manage things for herself, in her own way.</p>
<p>Whatever her thoughts might be, she could at least control her
acts.&nbsp; And those acts should be based not on woman&rsquo;s 
weakness, but on man&rsquo;s strength!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE NEED OF KNOWING</h2>
<p>When Stephen announced her intention of going with her father 
to the Petty Sessions Court, there was consternation amongst the 
female population of Normanstand and Norwood.&nbsp; Such a thing 
had not been heard of in the experiences of any of them.&nbsp; 
Courts of Justice were places for men; and the lower courts dealt
with a class of cases . . . It was quite impossible to imagine 
where any young lady could get such an idea . . .</p>
<p>Miss Laetitia Rowly recognised that she had a difficult task 
before her, for she was by now accustomed to Stephen&rsquo;s 
quiet method of having her own way.</p>
<p>She made a careful toilet before driving over to 
Normanstand.&nbsp; Her wearing her best bonnet was a circumstance
not unattended with dread for some one.&nbsp; Behold her then, 
sailing into the great drawing-room at Normanstand with her mind 
so firmly fixed on the task before her as to be oblivious of 
minor considerations.&nbsp; She was so fond of Stephen, and 
admired so truly her many beauties and fine qualities, that she 
was secure and without flaw in her purpose.&nbsp; Stephen was in 
danger, and though she doubted if she would be able to effect any
change, she was determined that at least she should not go into 
danger with her eyes unopened.</p>
<p>Stephen entered hastily and ran to her.&nbsp; She loved her 
great-aunt; really and truly loved her.&nbsp; And indeed it would
have been strange if she had not, for from the earliest hour 
which she could recollect she had received from her nothing but 
the truest, fondest affection.&nbsp; Moreover she deeply 
respected the old lady, her truth, her resolution, her 
kindliness, her genuine common-sense ability.&nbsp; Stephen 
always felt safe with her aunt.&nbsp; In the presence of others 
she might now and again have a qualm or a doubt; but not with 
her.&nbsp; There was an abiding calm in her love, answering love 
realised and respected.&nbsp; Her long and intimate knowledge of 
Laetitia made her aware of her moods.&nbsp; She could read the 
signs of them.&nbsp; She knew well the meaning of the bonnet 
which actually seemed to quiver as though it had a sentience of 
its own.&nbsp; She knew well the cause of her aunt&rsquo;s 
perturbation; the pain which must be caused to her was perhaps 
the point of most resistance in herself&mdash;she having made up 
her mind to her new experience.&nbsp; All she could do would be 
to try to reconcile her by the assurance of good intention; by 
reason, and by sweetness of manner.&nbsp; When she had kissed her
and sat beside her, holding her hand after her pretty way, she, 
seeing the elder woman somewhat at a loss, opened the subject 
herself:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You look troubled, auntie!&nbsp; I hope it is nothing 
serious?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is, my dear!&nbsp; Very serious!&nbsp; Everything is
serious to me which touches you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Me, Auntie!&rsquo;&nbsp; Hypocrisy is a fine art.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes! yes, Stephen.&nbsp; Oh! my dear child, what is 
this I hear about your going to Petty Sessions with your 
father?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, that!&nbsp; Why, Auntie dear, you must not let that
trouble you.&nbsp; It is all right.&nbsp; That is 
necessary!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Necessary!&rsquo; the old lady&rsquo;s figure grew 
rigid and her voice was loud and high.&nbsp; &lsquo;Necessary for
a young lady to go to a court house.&nbsp; To hear low people 
speaking of low crimes.&nbsp; To listen to cases of the most 
shocking kind; cases of low immorality; cases of a kind, of a 
nature of a&mdash;a&mdash;class that you are not supposed to know
anything about.&nbsp; Really, Stephen! . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; She 
was drawing away her hand in indignation.&nbsp; But Stephen held 
it tight, as she said very sweetly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is just it, Auntie.&nbsp; I am so ignorant that I 
feel I should know more of the lives of those very 
people!&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss Laetitia interrupted:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ignorant!&nbsp; Of course you are ignorant.&nbsp; That 
is what you ought to be.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it what we have all 
been devoting ourselves to effect ever since you were born?&nbsp;
Read your third chapter of Genesis and remember what came of 
eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think the Tree of Knowledge must have been an orange 
tree.&rsquo;&nbsp; The old lady looked up, her interest 
aroused:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because ever since Eden other brides have worn its 
blossom!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her tone was demure.&nbsp; Miss Rowly 
looked sharply at her, but her sharpness softened off into a 
smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;H&rsquo;m!&rsquo; she said, and was silent.&nbsp; 
Stephen seized the opportunity to put her own case:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Auntie dear, you must forgive me!&nbsp; You really 
must, for my heart is set on this.&nbsp; I assure you I am not 
doing it merely to please myself.&nbsp; I have thought over the 
whole matter.&nbsp; Father has always wished me to be in a 
position&mdash;a position of knowledge and experience&mdash;to 
manage Normanstand if I should ever succeed him.&nbsp; From the 
earliest time I can remember he has always kept this before me, 
and though of course I did not at first understand what it meant,
I have seemed in the last few years to know better.&nbsp; 
Accordingly I learned all sorts of things under his care, and 
sometimes even without his help.&nbsp; I have studied the estate 
map, and I have been over the estate books and read some of the 
leases and all such matters which they deal with in the estate 
office.&nbsp; This only told me the bones of the thing.&nbsp; I 
wanted to know more of our people; and so I made a point of going
now and again to each house that we own.&nbsp; Of seeing the 
people and talking with them familiarly; as familiarly as they 
would let me, and indeed so far as was possible considering my 
position.&nbsp; For, Auntie dear, I soon began to learn&mdash;to 
learn in a way there was no mistaking&mdash;what my position 
is.&nbsp; And so I want to get to know more of their ordinary 
lives; the darker as well as the lighter side.&nbsp; I would like
to do them good.&nbsp; I can see how my dear daddy has always 
been a sort of power to help them, and I would like to carry on 
his work; to carry it further if I may.&nbsp; But I must 
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her aunt had been listening with growing interest, and with 
growing respect too, for she realised the intense earnestness 
which lay behind the girl&rsquo;s words and her immediate 
purpose.&nbsp; Her voice and manner were both softened:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear, surely it is not necessary to go into the
Court to know these things.&nbsp; The results of each case become
known.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is just it, Auntie,&rsquo; she answered 
quickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;The magistrates have to hear the two sides 
of the case before even they can make up their minds.&nbsp; I 
want to hear both sides, too!&nbsp; If people are guilty, I want 
to know the cause of their guilt.&nbsp; If they are innocent, I 
want to know what the circumstances can be which make innocence 
look like guilt.&nbsp; In my own daily life I may be in the way 
of just such judgments; and surely it is only right that judgment
should be just!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again she paused; there rose before her mind that conversation
in the churchyard when Harold had said that it was difficult for 
women to be just.</p>
<p>Miss Rowly reflected too.&nbsp; She was becoming convinced 
that in principle the girl was right.&nbsp; But the details were 
repugnant as ever to her; concentrating her mind on the point 
where she felt the ground firm under her, she made her 
objection:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Stephen dear, there are so many cases that are 
sordid and painful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The more need to know of sordid things; if sordidness 
plays so important a part in the tragedy of their 
lives!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there are cases which are not within a 
woman&rsquo;s province.&nbsp; Cases that touch sin . . . 
&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What kind of sin do you mean?&nbsp; Surely all 
wrong-doing is sin!&rsquo;&nbsp; The old lady was 
embarrassed.&nbsp; Not by the fact, for she had been for too many
years the mistress of a great household not to know something of 
the subject on which she spoke, but that she had to speak of such
a matter to the young girl whom she so loved.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sin, my dear, of . . . of woman&rsquo;s wrong-doing
. . . as woman . . . of motherhood, without 
marriage!&rsquo;&nbsp; All Stephen&rsquo;s nature seemed to rise 
in revolt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Auntie,&rsquo; she spoke out at once, &lsquo;you 
yourself show the want of the very experience I look 
for!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How? what?&rsquo; asked the old lady amazed and 
bristling.&nbsp; Stephen took her hand and held it affectionately
as she spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You speak of a woman&rsquo;s wrong-doing, when surely 
it is a man&rsquo;s as well.&nbsp; There does not seem to be 
blame for him who is the more guilty.&nbsp; Only for poor women! 
. . . And, Auntie dear, it is such poor women that I should like 
to help . . . Not when it is too late, but before!&nbsp; But how 
can I help unless I know?&nbsp; Good girls cannot tell me, and 
good women won&rsquo;t!&nbsp; You yourself, Auntie, didn&rsquo;t 
want to speak on the subject; even to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear child, these are not things for unmarried 
women.&nbsp; I never speak of them myself except with 
matrons.&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s answer flashed out like a 
sword; and cut like one:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet you are unmarried!&nbsp; Oh, Auntie dear, I did
not and I do not mean to be offensive, or to hurt you in any 
way.&nbsp; I know, dear, your goodness and your kindness to 
all.&nbsp; But you limit yourself to one side!&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
elder lady interrupted:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you mean? one side! which side?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The punishment side.&nbsp; I want to know the cause of 
that which brings the punishment.&nbsp; There surely is some 
cross road in a girl&rsquo;s life where the ways part.&nbsp; I 
want to stand there if I can, with warning in one hand and help 
in the other.&nbsp; Oh! Auntie, Auntie, can&rsquo;t you see that 
my heart is in this . . . These are our people; Daddy says they 
are to be my people; and I want to know their lives right 
through; to understand their wants, and their temptations, and 
their weakness.&nbsp; Bad and good, whatever it be, I must know 
it all; or I shall be working in the dark, and may injure or 
crush where I had looked to help and raise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke she looked glorified.&nbsp; The afternoon autumn 
sun shone full through the great window and lighted her up till 
she looked like a spirit.&nbsp; Lighted her white diaphanous 
dress till it seemed to take shape as an ethereal robe; lighted 
her red hair till it looked like a celestial crown; lighted her 
great dark eyes till their black beauty became swept in the tide 
of glory.</p>
<p>The heart of the old woman who loved her best heaved, and her 
bosom swelled with pride.&nbsp; Instinctively she spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you noble, beautiful creature!&nbsp; Of course you 
are right, and your way is God&rsquo;s way!&rsquo;&nbsp; With 
tears that rained down her furrowed cheeks, she put her arms 
round the girl and kissed her fondly.&nbsp; Still holding her in 
her arms she gave her the gentle counsel which was the aftermath 
of her moment of inspiration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But Stephen dear, do be careful!&nbsp; Knowledge is a 
two-edged sword, and it is apt to side with pride.&nbsp; Remember
what was the last temptation of the serpent to Eve: &ldquo;Your 
eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and 
evil.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be very careful,&rsquo; she said gravely; and 
then added as if by an afterthought, &lsquo;of course you 
understand that my motive is the acquisition of 
knowledge?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; the answer was given interrogatively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, dear, that Eve&rsquo;s object 
was not so much the acquisition of knowledge as the gratification
of curiosity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That may be,&rsquo; said the elder lady in a doubtful 
tone; &lsquo;but my dear, who is to enlighten us as to which is 
which?&nbsp; We are apt in such matters to deceive 
ourselves.&nbsp; The more we know, the better are we able to 
deceive others; and the better we are able to deceive others the 
better we are able to deceive ourselves.&nbsp; As I tell you, 
dear, knowledge is two-edged and needs extra carefulness in its 
use!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True!&rsquo; said Stephen reflectively.&nbsp; Long 
after her aunt had gone she sat thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Once again did Miss Rowly try to restrain Stephen from a 
project.&nbsp; This was when a little later she wished to go for 
a few days to the University Mission House in the East end of 
London.&nbsp; Ever since her visit to Oxford she had kept up a 
correspondence with her mother&rsquo;s old friend.&nbsp; It was 
this lady&rsquo;s habit to spend a part of vacation in the 
Mission; and Stephen had had much correspondence with her 
regarding the work.&nbsp; At last she wrote that if she might, 
she would like to come and see for herself.&nbsp; The answer was 
a cordial invitation, armed with which she asked her father to 
allow her to go.&nbsp; He at once assented.&nbsp; He had been 
watching keenly the development of her character, and had seen 
with pride and satisfaction that as time went on she seemed to 
acquire greater resolution, larger self-dependence.&nbsp; She was
becoming more and more of his ideal.&nbsp; Without losing any of 
her womanhood, she was beginning to look at things more from a 
man&rsquo;s point of view than is usually done by, or possible 
to, women.</p>
<p>When she returned at the end of a week she was full of new 
gravity.&nbsp; After a while this so far changed that her old 
lighter moods began to have their place, but it seemed that she 
never lost, and that she never would lose, the effect of that 
week of bitter experience amongst the &lsquo;submerged 
tenth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The effect of the mental working was shown by a remark made by
Harold when home on his next college vacation.&nbsp; He had been 
entering with her on a discussion of an episode on the 
estate:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stephen, you are learning to be just!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the moment she was chagrined by the remark, though she 
accepted it in silence; but later, when she had thought the 
matter over, she took from it infinite pleasure.&nbsp; This was 
indeed to share man&rsquo;s ideas and to think with the workings 
of man&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; It encouraged her to further and 
larger ideas, and to a greater toleration than she had hitherto 
dreamed of.</p>
<p>Of all those who loved her, none seemed to understand so fully
as Laetitia Rowly the change in her mental attitude, or rather 
the development of it.&nbsp; Now and again she tried to deflect 
or modify certain coming forces, so that the educational process 
in which she had always had a part would continue in the right 
direction.&nbsp; But she generally found that the girl had been 
over the ground so thoroughly that she was able to defend her 
position.&nbsp; Once, when she had ventured to remonstrate with 
her regarding her attitude of woman&rsquo;s equality with man, 
she felt as if Stephen&rsquo;s barque was indeed entering on 
dangerous seas.&nbsp; The occasion had arisen thus: Stephen had 
been what her aunt had stigmatised as &lsquo;laying down the 
law&rsquo; with regard to the position a married woman, and Miss 
Rowly, seeing a good argumentative opening, remarked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But what if a woman does not get the opportunity of 
being married?&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen looked at her a moment before
saying with conviction:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a woman&rsquo;s fault if she does not get the 
opportunity!&rsquo;&nbsp; The old lady smiled as she 
answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her fault?&nbsp; My dear, what if no man asks 
her?&rsquo;&nbsp; This seemed to her own mind a poser.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still her own fault!&nbsp; Why doesn&rsquo;t she ask 
him?&rsquo;&nbsp; Her aunt&rsquo;s lorgnon was dropped in 
horrified amazement.</p>
<p>Stephen went on impassively.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly!&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; 
Marriage is a union.&nbsp; As it is in the eye of the law a civil
contract, either party to it should be at liberty to originate 
the matter.&nbsp; If a woman is not free to think of a man in all
ways, how is she to judge of the suitability of their 
union?&nbsp; And if she is free in theory, why not free to 
undertake if necessary the initiative in a matter so momentous to
herself?&rsquo;&nbsp; The old lady actually groaned and wrung her
hands; she was horrified at such sentiments.&nbsp; They were 
daring enough to think; but to put them in words! . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my dear, my dear!&rsquo; she moaned, &lsquo;be 
careful what you say.&nbsp; Some one might hear you who would not
understand, as I do, that you are talking theory.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Stephen&rsquo;s habit of thought stood to her here.&nbsp; She saw
that her aunt was distressed, and as she did not wish to pain her
unduly, was willing to divert the immediate channel of her 
fear.&nbsp; She took the hand which lay in her lap and held it 
firmly whilst she smiled in the loving old eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, Auntie dear, it is theory.&nbsp; But still 
it is a theory which I hold very strongly!&rsquo; . . . Here a 
thought struck her and she said suddenly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you ever . . . How many proposals did you have, 
Auntie?&rsquo;&nbsp; The old lady smiled; her thoughts were 
already diverted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Several, my dear!&nbsp; It is so long ago that I 
don&rsquo;t remember!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, you do, Auntie!&nbsp; No woman ever forgets 
that, no matter what else she may or may not remember!&nbsp; Tell
me, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&nbsp; The old lady blushed slightly 
as she answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no need to specify, my dear.&nbsp; Let it be 
at this, that there were more than you could count on your right 
hand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why did you refuse them?&rsquo;&nbsp; The tone was 
wheedling, and the elder woman loved to hear it.&nbsp; Wheedling 
is the courtship, by the young of the old.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, my dear, I didn&rsquo;t love them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But tell me, Auntie, was there never any one that you 
did love?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! my dear, that is a different matter.&nbsp; That is 
the real tragedy of a woman&rsquo;s life.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 
flooding reminiscent thought she forgot her remonstrating; her 
voice became full of natural pathos:</p>
<p>&lsquo;To love; and be helpless!&nbsp; To wait, and wait, and 
wait; with your heart all aflame!&nbsp; To hope, and hope; till 
time seems to have passed away, and all the world to stand still 
on your hopeless misery!&nbsp; To know that a word might open up 
Heaven; and yet to have to remain mute!&nbsp; To keep back the 
glances that could enlighten; to modulate the tones that might 
betray!&nbsp; To see all you hoped for passing away . . . to 
another! . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen bent over and kissed her, then standing up said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand!&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it wrong, Auntie, that 
there should be such tragedies?&nbsp; Should not that glance be 
given?&nbsp; Why should that tone be checked?&nbsp; Why should 
one be mute when a single word might, would, avert the 
tragedy?&nbsp; Is it not possible, Auntie, that there is 
something wrong in our social system when such things can happen;
and can happen so often?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked remorseless as well as irresistible in the pride of
her youthful strength as with eyes that blazed, not flashing as 
in passion but with a steady light that seemed to burn, she 
continued:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some day women must learn their own strength, as well 
as they have learned their own weakness.&nbsp; They are taught 
this latter from their cradles up; but no one ever seems to teach
them wherein their power lies.&nbsp; They have to learn this for 
themselves; and the process and the result of the self-teaching 
are not good.&nbsp; In the University Settlement I learned much 
that made my heart ache; but out of it there seemed some lesson 
for good.&rsquo;&nbsp; She paused; and her aunt, wishing to keep 
the subject towards higher things, asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And that lesson, Stephen dear?&rsquo;&nbsp; The blazing
eyes turned to her so that she was stirred by them as the answer 
came:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is bad women who seem to know men best, and to be 
able to influence them most.&nbsp; They can make men come and go 
at will.&nbsp; They can turn and twist and mould them as they 
choose.&nbsp; And <i>they</i> never hesitate to speak their own 
wishes; to ask for what they want.&nbsp; There are no tragedies, 
of the negative kind, in <i>their</i> lives.&nbsp; Their 
tragedies have come and gone already; and their power 
remains.&nbsp; Why should good women leave power to such as 
they?&nbsp; Why should good women&rsquo;s lives be wrecked for a 
convention?&nbsp; Why in the blind following of some society 
fetish should life lose its charm, its possibilities?&nbsp; Why 
should love eat its heart out, in vain?&nbsp; The time will come 
when women will not be afraid to speak to men, as they should 
speak, as free and equal.&nbsp; Surely if a woman is to be the 
equal and lifelong companion of a man, the closest to 
him&mdash;nay, the only one really close to him: the mother of 
his children&mdash;she should be free at the very outset to show 
her inclination to him just as he would to her.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
be frightened, Auntie dear; your eyes are paining me! . . . 
There! perhaps I said too much.&nbsp; But after all it is only 
theory.&nbsp; Take for your comfort, Auntie dear, that I am free 
an heart-whole.&nbsp; You need not fear for me; I can see what 
your dear eyes tell me.&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; I am very young; perhaps
too young to think such things.&nbsp; But I have thought of 
them.&nbsp; Thought them all over in every way and phase I can 
imagine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly; bending over, she took the old lady in 
her arms and kissed her fondly several times, holding her 
tight.&nbsp; Then, as suddenly releasing her, she ran away before
she could say a word.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE T-CART</h2>
<p>When Harold took his degree, Stephen&rsquo;s father took her 
to Cambridge.&nbsp; She enjoyed the trip very much; indeed, it 
seemed under conditions that were absolutely happy.</p>
<p>When they had returned to Normanstand, the Squire took an 
early opportunity of bringing Harold alone into his study.&nbsp; 
He spoke to him with what in a very young man would have seemed 
diffidence:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been thinking, Harold, that the time has come 
when you should be altogether your own master.&nbsp; I am more 
than pleased, my boy, with the way you have gone through college;
it is, I am sure, just as your dear father would have wished it, 
and as it would have pleased him best.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused, 
and Harold said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tried hard, sir, to do what I thought he would like; 
and what you would.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Squire went on more 
cheerfully:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that, my boy!&nbsp; I know that well.&nbsp; And 
I can tell you that it is not the least of the pleasures we have 
all had in your success, how you have justified yourself.&nbsp; 
You have won many honours in the schools, and you have kept the 
reputation as an athlete which your father was so proud of.&nbsp;
Well, I suppose in the natural order of things you would go into 
a profession; and of course if you so desire you can do 
that.&nbsp; But if you can see your way to it I would rather that
you stayed here.&nbsp; My house is your home as long as I live; 
but I don&rsquo;t wish you to feel in any way dependent.&nbsp; I 
want you to stay here if you will; but to do it just because you 
wish to.&nbsp; To this end I have made over to you the estate at 
Camp which was my father&rsquo;s gift to me when I came of 
age.&nbsp; It is not a very large one; but it will give you a 
nice position of your own, and a comfortable income.&nbsp; And 
with it goes my blessing, my dear boy.&nbsp; Take it as a gift 
from your father and myself!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold was much moved, not only by the act itself but by the 
gracious way of doing it.&nbsp; There were tears in his eyes as 
he wrung the Squire&rsquo;s hand; his voice thrilled with feeling
as he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your many goodnesses to my father&rsquo;s son, sir, 
will, I hope, be justified by his love and loyalty.&nbsp; If I 
don&rsquo;t say much it is because I do not feel quite master of 
myself.&nbsp; I shall try to show in time, as I cannot say it all
at once, all that I feel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold continued to live at Normanstand.&nbsp; The house at 
Camp was in reality a charming cottage.&nbsp; A couple of 
servants were installed, and now and again he stayed there for a 
few days as he wished to get accustomed to the place.&nbsp; In a 
couple of months every one accepted the order of things; and life
at Normanstand went on much as it had done before Harold had gone
to college.&nbsp; There was a man in the house now instead of a 
boy: that was all.&nbsp; Stephen too was beginning to be a young 
woman, but the relative positions were the same as they had 
been.&nbsp; Her growth did not seem to make an ostensible 
difference to any one.&nbsp; The one who might have noticed it 
most, Mrs. Jarrold, had died during the last year of 
Harold&rsquo;s life at college.</p>
<p>When the day came for the quarterly meeting of the magistrates
of the county of Norcester, Squire Rowly arranged as usual to 
drive Squire Norman.&nbsp; This had been their habit for good 
many years.&nbsp; The two men usually liked to talk over the 
meeting as they returned home together.&nbsp; It was a beautiful 
morning for a drive, and when Rowly came flying up the avenue in 
his T-cart with three magnificent bays, Stephen ran out on the 
top of the steps to see him draw up.&nbsp; Rowly was a fine whip,
and his horses felt it.&nbsp; Squire Norman was ready, and, after
a kiss from Stephen, climbed into the high cart.&nbsp; The men 
raised their hats and waved good-bye.&nbsp; A word from Rowly; 
with a bound the horses were off.&nbsp; Stephen stood looking at 
them delighted; all was so sunny, so bright, so happy.&nbsp; The 
world was so full of life and happiness to-day that it seemed as 
if it would never end; that nothing except good could befall.</p>
<p>Harold, later on that morning, was to go into Norcester also; 
so Stephen with a lonely day before her set herself to take up 
loose-ends of all sorts of little personal matters.&nbsp; They 
would all meet at dinner as Rowly was to stop the night at 
Normanstand.</p>
<p>Harold left the club in good time to ride home to 
dinner.&nbsp; As he passed the County Hotel he stopped to ask if 
Squire Norman had left; and was told that he had started only a 
short time before with Squire Rowly in his T-cart.&nbsp; He rode 
on fast, thinking that perhaps he might overtake them and ride on
with them.&nbsp; But the bays knew their work, and did it.&nbsp; 
They kept their start; it was only at the top of the North hill, 
five miles out of Norcester, that he saw them in the distance, 
flying along the level road.&nbsp; He knew he would not now 
overtake them, and so rode on somewhat more leisurely.</p>
<p>The Norcester highroad, when it has passed the village of 
Brackling, turns away to the right behind the great clump of 
oaks.&nbsp; From this the road twists to the left again, making a
double curve, and then runs to Norling Parva in a clear stretch 
of some miles before reaching the sharp turn down the hill which 
is marked &lsquo;Dangerous to Cyclists.&rsquo;&nbsp; From the 
latter village branches the by-road over the hill which is the 
short cut to Normanstand.</p>
<p>When Harold turned the corner under the shadow of the oaks he 
saw a belated road-mender, surrounded by some gaping peasants, 
pointing excitedly in the distance.&nbsp; The man, who of course 
knew him, called to him to stop.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; he asked, reining up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It be Squire Rowly&rsquo;s bays which have run away 
with him.&nbsp; Three on &rsquo;em, all in a row and comin&rsquo;
like the wind.&nbsp; Squire he had his reins all right, but they 
&rsquo;osses didn&rsquo;t seem to mind &rsquo;un.&nbsp; They was 
fair mad and bolted.&nbsp; The leader he had got frightened at 
the heap o&rsquo; stones theer, an&rsquo; the others took scare 
from him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Without a word Harold shook his reins and touched the horse 
with his whip.&nbsp; The animal seemed to understand and sprang 
forward, covering the ground at a terrific pace.&nbsp; Harold was
not given to alarms, but here might be serious danger.&nbsp; 
Three spirited horses in a light cart made for pace, all bolting 
in fright, might end any moment in calamity.&nbsp; Never in his 
life did he ride faster than on the road to Norling Parva.&nbsp; 
Far ahead of him he could see at the turn, now and again, a 
figure running.&nbsp; Something had happened.&nbsp; His heart 
grew cold: he knew as well as though he had seen it, the high 
cart swaying on one wheel round the corner as the maddened horses
tore on their way; the one jerk too much, and the momentary 
reaction in the crash! . . .</p>
<p>With beating heart and eyes aflame in his white face he dashed
on.</p>
<p>It was all too true.&nbsp; By the side of the roadway on the 
inner curve lay the cart on its side with broken shafts.&nbsp; 
The horses were prancing and stamping about along the roadway not
recovered from their fright.&nbsp; Each was held by several 
men.</p>
<p>And on the grass two figures were still lying where they had 
been thrown out.&nbsp; Rowly, who had of course been on the 
off-side, had been thrown furthest.&nbsp; His head had struck the
milestone that stood back on the waste ground before the 
ditch.&nbsp; There was no need for any one to tell that his neck 
had been broken.&nbsp; The way his head lay on one side, and the 
twisted, inert limbs, all told their story plainly enough.</p>
<p>Squire Norman lay on his back stretched out.&nbsp; Some one 
had raised him to a sitting posture and then lowered him again, 
straightening his limbs.&nbsp; He did not therefore look so 
dreadful as Rowly, but there were signs of coming death in the 
stertorous breathing, the ooze of blood from nostrils and ears as
well as mouth.&nbsp; Harold knelt down by him at once and 
examined him.&nbsp; Those who were round all knew him and stood 
back.&nbsp; He felt the ribs and limbs; so far as he could 
ascertain by touch no bone was broken.</p>
<p>Just then the local doctor, for whom some one had run, arrived
in his gig.&nbsp; He, too, knelt beside the injured man, a quick 
glance having satisfied him that there was only one patient 
requiring his care.&nbsp; Harold stood up and waited.&nbsp; The 
doctor looked up, shaking his head.&nbsp; Harold could hardly 
suppress the groan which was rising in his throat.&nbsp; He 
asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it immediate?&nbsp; Should his daughter be brought 
here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long would it take her to arrive?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps half an hour; she would not lose an 
instant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you had better send for her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall go at once!&rsquo; answered Harold, turning to 
jump on his horse, which was held on the road.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;send some one 
else.&nbsp; You had better stay here yourself.&nbsp; He may 
become conscious just before the end; and he may want to say 
something!&rsquo;&nbsp; It seemed to Harold that a great bell was
sounding in his ears.&mdash;&lsquo;Before the end!&nbsp; Good 
God!&nbsp; Poor Stephen!&rsquo; . . . But this was no time for 
sorrow, or for thinking of it.&nbsp; That would come later.&nbsp;
All that was possible must be done; and to do it required a cool 
head.&nbsp; He called to one of the lads he knew could ride and 
said to him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get on my horse and ride as fast as you can to 
Normanstand.&nbsp; Send at once to Miss Norman and tell her that 
she is wanted instantly.&nbsp; Tell her that there has been an 
accident; that her father is alive, but that she must come at 
once without a moment&rsquo;s delay.&nbsp; She had better ride my
horse back as it will save time.&nbsp; She will understand from 
that the importance of time.&nbsp; Quick!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The lad sprang to the saddle, and was off in a flash.&nbsp; 
Whilst Harold was speaking, the doctor had told the men, who, 
accustomed to hunting accidents, had taken a gate from its hinges
and held it in readiness, to bring it closer.&nbsp; Then under 
his direction the Squire was placed on the gate.&nbsp; The 
nearest house was only about a hundred yards away; and thither 
they bore him.&nbsp; He was lifted on a bed, and then the doctor 
made fuller examination.&nbsp; When he stood up he looked very 
grave and said to Harold:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I greatly fear she cannot arrive in time.&nbsp; That 
bleeding from the ears means rupture of the brain.&nbsp; It is 
relieving the pressure, however, and he may recover consciousness
before he dies.&nbsp; You had better be close to him.&nbsp; There
is at present nothing that can be done.&nbsp; If he becomes 
conscious at all it will be suddenly.&nbsp; He will relapse and 
probably die as quickly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All at once Norman opened his eyes, and seeing him said 
quietly, as he looked around:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What place is this, Harold?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Martin&rsquo;s&mdash;James Martin&rsquo;s, sir.&nbsp; 
You were brought here after the accident.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I remember!&nbsp; Am I badly hurt?&nbsp; I can 
feel nothing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear so, sir!&nbsp; I have sent for 
Stephen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sent for Stephen!&nbsp; Am I about to die?&rsquo;&nbsp;
His voice, though feeble, was grave and even.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alas! sir, I fear so!&rsquo;&nbsp; He sank on his knees
as he spoke and took him, his second father, in his arms.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it close?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then listen to me!&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t see Stephen, 
give her my love and blessing!&nbsp; Say that with my last breath
I prayed God to keep her and make her happy!&nbsp; You will tell 
her this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will!&nbsp; I will!&rsquo;&nbsp; He could hardly 
speak for the emotion which was choking him.&nbsp; Then the voice
went on, but slower and weaker:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Harold, my dear boy, you will look after her, will 
you not?&nbsp; Guard her and cherish her, as if you were indeed 
my son and she your sister!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will.&nbsp; So help me God!&rsquo;&nbsp; There was a 
pause of a few seconds which seemed an interminable time.&nbsp; 
Then in a feebler voice Squire Norman spoke again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And Harold&mdash;bend down&mdash;I must whisper!&nbsp; 
If it should be that in time you and Stephen should find that 
there is another affection between you, remember that I sanction 
it&mdash;with my dying breath.&nbsp; But give her time!&nbsp; I 
trust that to you!&nbsp; She is young, and the world is all 
before her.&nbsp; Let her choose . . . and be loyal to her if it 
is another!&nbsp; It may be a hard task, but I trust you, 
Harold.&nbsp; God bless you, my other son!&rsquo;&nbsp; He rose 
slightly and listened.&nbsp; Harold&rsquo;s heart leaped.&nbsp; 
The swift hoof-strokes of a galloping horse were heard . . . The 
father spoke joyously:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There she is!&nbsp; That is my brave girl!&nbsp; God 
grant that she may be in time.&nbsp; I know what it will mean to 
her hereafter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The horse stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>A quick patter of feet along the passage and then Stephen half
dressed with a peignoir thrown over her, swept into the 
room.&nbsp; With the soft agility of a leopard she threw herself 
on her knees beside her father and put her arms round him.&nbsp; 
The dying man motioned to Harold to raise him.&nbsp; When this 
had been done he laid his hand tenderly on his daughter&rsquo;s 
head, saying:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let now, O Lord, Thy servant depart in peace!&nbsp; God
bless and keep you, my dear child!&nbsp; You have been all your 
life a joy and a delight to me!&nbsp; I shall tell your mother 
when I meet her all that you have been to me!&nbsp; Harold, be 
good to her!&nbsp; Good-bye&mdash;Stephen! . . . Margaret! . . . 
&rsquo;</p>
<p>His head fell over, and Harold, laying him gently down, knelt 
beside Stephen.&nbsp; He put his arm round her; and she, turning 
to him, laid her hand on his breast and sobbed as though her 
heart would break.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The bodies of the two squires were brought to 
Normanstand.&nbsp; Rowly had long ago said that if he died 
unmarried he would like to lie beside his half-sister, and that 
it was fitting that, as Stephen would be the new Squire of 
Norwood, her dust should in time lie by his.&nbsp; When the 
terrible news of her nephew&rsquo;s and of Norman&rsquo;s death 
came to Norwood, Miss Laetitia hurried off to Normanstand as fast
as the horses could bring her.</p>
<p>Her coming was an inexpressible comfort to Stephen.&nbsp; 
After the first overwhelming burst of grief she had settled into 
an acute despair.&nbsp; Of course she had been helped by the fact
that Harold had been with her, and she was grateful for that 
too.&nbsp; But it did not live in her memory of gratitude in the 
same way.&nbsp; Of course Harold was with her in trouble!&nbsp; 
He had always been; would always be.</p>
<p>But the comfort which Aunt Laetitia could give was of a more 
positive kind.</p>
<p>From that hour Miss Rowly stayed at Normanstand.&nbsp; Stephen
wanted her; and she wanted to be with Stephen.</p>
<p>After the funeral Harold, with an instinctive delicacy of 
feeling, had gone to live in his own house; but he came to 
Normanstand every day.&nbsp; Stephen had so long been accustomed 
to consulting him about everything that there was no perceptible 
change in their relations.&nbsp; Even necessary business to be 
done did not come as a new thing.</p>
<p>And so things went on outwardly at Normanstand very much as 
they had done before the coming of the tragedy.&nbsp; But for a 
long time Stephen had occasional bursts of grief which to witness
was positive anguish to those who loved her.</p>
<p>Then her duty towards her neighbours became a sort of 
passion.&nbsp; She did not spare herself by day or by 
night.&nbsp; With swift intuition she grasped the needs of any 
ill case which came before her, and with swift movement she took 
the remedy in hand.</p>
<p>Her aunt saw and approved.&nbsp; Stephen, she felt, was in 
this way truly fulfilling her duty as a woman.&nbsp; The old lady
began to secretly hope, and almost to believe, that she had laid 
aside those theories whose carrying into action she so 
dreaded.</p>
<p>But theories do not die so easily.&nbsp; It is from theory 
that practice takes its real strength, as well as its 
direction.&nbsp; And did the older woman whose life had been 
bound under more orderly restraint but know, Stephen was 
following out her theories, remorselessly and to the end.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX&mdash;IN THE SPRING</h2>
<p>The months since her father&rsquo;s death spread into the 
second year before Stephen began to realise the loneliness of her
life.&nbsp; She had no companion now but her aunt; and though the
old lady adored her, and she returned her love in full, the mere 
years between them made impossible the companionship that youth 
craves.&nbsp; Miss Rowly&rsquo;s life was in the past.&nbsp; 
Stephen&rsquo;s was in the future.&nbsp; And loneliness is a 
feeling which comes unbidden to a heart.</p>
<p>Stephen felt her loneliness all round.&nbsp; In old days 
Harold was always within hail, and companionship of equal age and
understanding was available.&nbsp; But now his very reticence in 
her own interest, and by her father&rsquo;s wishes, made for her 
pain.&nbsp; Harold had put his strongest restraint on himself, 
and in his own way suffered a sort of silent martyrdom.&nbsp; He 
loved Stephen with every fibre of his being.&nbsp; Day by day he 
came toward her with eager step; day by day he left her with a 
pang that made his heart ache and seemed to turn the brightness 
of the day to gloom.&nbsp; Night by night he tossed for hours 
thinking, thinking, wondering if the time would ever come when 
her kisses would be his . . . But the tortures and terrors of the
night had their effect on his days.&nbsp; It seemed as if the 
mere act of thinking, of longing, gave him ever renewed 
self-control, so that he was able in his bearing to carry out the
task he had undertaken: to give Stephen time to choose a mate for
herself.&nbsp; Herein lay his weakness&mdash;a weakness coming 
from his want of knowledge of the world of women.&nbsp; Had he 
ever had a love affair, be it never so mild a one, he would have 
known that love requires a positive expression.&nbsp; It is not 
sufficient to sigh, and wish, and hope, and long, all to 
oneself.&nbsp; Stephen felt instinctively that his guarded speech
and manner were due to the coldness&mdash;or rather the trusting 
abated worship&mdash;of the brotherhood to which she had been 
always accustomed.&nbsp; At the time when new forces were 
manifesting and expanding themselves within her; when her growing
instincts, cultivated by the senses and the passions of young 
nature, made her aware of other forces, new and old, expanding 
themselves outside her; at the time when the heart of a girl is 
eager for new impressions and new expansions, and the calls of 
sex are working within her all unconsciously, Harold, to whom her
heart would probably have been the first to turn, made himself in
his effort to best show his love, a <i>quantit&eacute; 
negligeable</i>.</p>
<p>Thus Stephen, whilst feeling that the vague desires of budding
womanhood were trembling within her, had neither thought nor 
knowledge of their character or their ultimate tendency.&nbsp; 
She would have been shocked, horrified, had that logical process,
which she applied so freely to less personal matters, been used 
upon her own intimate nature.&nbsp; In her case logic would of 
course act within a certain range; and as logic is a conscious 
intellectual process, she became aware that her objective was 
man.&nbsp; Man&mdash;in the abstract.&nbsp; &lsquo;Man,&rsquo; 
not &lsquo;a man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Beyond that, she could not 
go.&nbsp; It is not too much to say that she did not ever, even 
in her most errant thought, apply her reasoning, or even dream of
its following out either the duties, the responsibilities, or the
consequences of having a husband.&nbsp; She had a vague longing 
for younger companionship, and of the kind naturally most 
interesting to her.&nbsp; There thought stopped.</p>
<p>One only of her male acquaintances did not at this time 
appear.&nbsp; Leonard Everard, who had some time ago finished his
course at college, was living partly in London and partly on the 
Continent.&nbsp; His very absence made him of added interest to 
his old play-fellow.&nbsp; The image of his grace and comeliness,
of his dominance and masculine force, early impressed on her 
mind, began to compare favourably with the actualities of her 
other friends; those of them at least who were within the circle 
of her personal interest.&nbsp; &lsquo;Absence makes the heart 
grow fonder.&rsquo;&nbsp; In Stephen&rsquo;s mind had been but a 
very mustard-seed of fondness.&nbsp; But new lights were breaking
for her; and all of them, in greater or lesser degree, shone in 
turn on the memory of the pretty self-willed dominant boy, who 
now grew larger and more masculine in stature under the instance 
of each successive light.&nbsp; Stephen knew the others fairly 
well through and through.&nbsp; The usual mixture of good and 
evil, of strength and weakness, of purpose and vacillation, was 
quite within the scope of her own feeling and of her 
observation.&nbsp; But this man was something of a problem to 
her; and, as such, had a prominence in her thoughts quite beyond 
his own worthiness.</p>
<p>In movement of some form is life; and even ideas grow when the
pulses beat and thought quickens.&nbsp; Stephen had long had in 
her mind the idea of sexual equality.&nbsp; For a long time, in 
deference to her aunt&rsquo;s feelings, she had not spoken of it;
for the old lady winced in general under any suggestion of a 
breach of convention.&nbsp; But though her outward expression 
being thus curbed had helped to suppress or minimise the 
opportunities of inward thought, the idea had never left 
her.&nbsp; Now, when sex was, consciously or unconsciously, a 
dominating factor in her thoughts, the dormant idea woke to new 
life.&nbsp; She had held that if men and women were equal the 
woman should have equal rights and opportunities as the 
man.&nbsp; It had been, she believed, an absurd conventional rule
that such a thing as a proposal of marriage should be entirely 
the prerogative of man.</p>
<p>And then came to her, as it ever does to woman, 
opportunity.&nbsp; Opportunity, the cruelest, most remorseless, 
most unsparing, subtlest foe that womanhood has.&nbsp; Here was 
an opportunity for her to test her own theory; to prove to 
herself, and others, that she was right.&nbsp; 
They&mdash;&lsquo;they&rsquo; being the impersonal opponents of, 
or unbelievers in, her theory&mdash;would see that a woman could 
propose as well as a man; and that the result would be good.</p>
<p>It is a part of self-satisfaction, and perhaps not the least 
dangerous part of it, that it has an increasing or multiplying 
power of its own.&nbsp; The desire to do increases the power to 
do; and desire and power united find new ways for the exercise of
strength.&nbsp; Up to now Stephen&rsquo;s inclination towards 
Leonard had been vague, nebulous; but now that theory showed a 
way to its utilisation it forthwith began to become, first 
definite, then concrete, then substantial.&nbsp; When once the 
idea had become a possibility, the mere passing of time did the 
rest.</p>
<p>Her aunt saw&mdash;and misunderstood.&nbsp; The lesson of her 
own youth had not been applied; not even of those long hours and 
days and weeks at which she hinted when she had spoken of the 
tragedy of life which by inference was her own tragedy: &lsquo;to
love and to be helpless.&nbsp; To wait, and wait, and wait, with 
your heart all aflame!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen recognised her aunt&rsquo;s concern for her health in 
time to protect herself from the curiosity of her 
loving-kindness.&nbsp; Her youth and readiness and adaptability, 
and that power of play-acting which we all have within us and of 
which she had her share, stood to her.&nbsp; With but little 
effort, based on a seeming acquiescence in her aunt&rsquo;s 
views, she succeeded in convincing the old lady that her 
incipient feverish cold had already reached its crisis and was 
passing away.&nbsp; But she had gained certain knowledge in the 
playing of her little part.&nbsp; All this self-protective 
instinct was new; for good or ill she had advanced one more step 
in not only the knowledge but the power of duplicity which is so 
necessary in the conventional life of a woman.</p>
<p>Oh! did we but see!&nbsp; Could we but see!&nbsp; Here was a 
woman, dowered in her youth with all the goods and graces in the 
power of the gods to bestow, who fought against convention; and 
who yet found in convention the strongest as well as the readiest
weapon of defence.</p>
<p>For nearly two weeks Stephen&rsquo;s resolution was held 
motionless, neither advancing nor receding; it was veritably the 
slack water of her resolution.&nbsp; She was afraid to go 
on.&nbsp; Not afraid in sense of fear as it is usually 
understood, but with the opposition of virginal instincts; those 
instincts which are natural, but whose uses as well as whose 
powers are unknown to us.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X&mdash;THE RESOLVE</h2>
<p>The next few days saw Stephen abnormally restless.&nbsp; She 
had fairly well made up her mind to test her theory of equality 
of the sexes by asking Leonard Everard to marry her; but her 
difficulty was as to the doing it.&nbsp; She knew well that it 
would not do to depend on a chance meeting for an 
opportunity.&nbsp; After all, the matter was too serious to allow
of the possibility of levity.&nbsp; There were times when she 
thought she would write to him and make her proffer of affection 
in this way; but on every occasion when such thought recurred it 
was forthwith instantly abandoned.&nbsp; During the last few 
days, however, she became more reconciled to even this method of 
procedure.&nbsp; The fever of growth was unabated.&nbsp; At last 
came an evening which she had all to herself.&nbsp; Miss Laetitia
was going over to Norwood to look after matters there, and would 
remain the night.&nbsp; Stephen saw in her absence an opportunity
for thought and action, and said that, having a headache, she 
would remain at home.&nbsp; Her aunt offered to postpone her 
visit.&nbsp; But she would not hear of it; and so she had the 
evening to herself.</p>
<p>After dinner in her boudoir she set herself to the composition
of a letter to Leonard which would convey at least something of 
her feelings and wishes towards him.&nbsp; In the depths of her 
heart, which now and again beat furiously, she had a secret hope 
that when once the idea was broached Leonard would do the 
rest.&nbsp; And as she thought of that &lsquo;rest&rsquo; a 
languorous dreaminess came upon her.&nbsp; She thought how he 
would come to her full of love, of yearning passion; how she 
would try to keep towards him, at first, an independent front 
which would preserve her secret anxiety until the time should 
come when she might yield herself to his arms and tell him 
all.&nbsp; For hours she wrote letter after letter, destroying 
them as quickly as she wrote, as she found that she had but 
swayed pendulum fashion between overtness and coldness.&nbsp; 
Some of the letters were so chilly in tone that she felt they 
would defeat their own object.&nbsp; Others were so frankly warm 
in the expression of&mdash;regard she called it, that with 
burning blushes she destroyed them at once at the candle before 
her.</p>
<p>At last she made up her mind.&nbsp; Just as she had done when 
a baby she realised that the opposing forces were too strong for 
her; she gave in gracefully.&nbsp; It would not do to deal 
directly in a letter with the matter in hand.&nbsp; She would 
write to Leonard merely asking him to see her.&nbsp; Then, when 
they were together without fear of interruption, she would tell 
him her views.</p>
<p>She got as far as &lsquo;Dear Mr. Leonard,&rsquo; when she 
stood up, saying to herself:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not be in a hurry.&nbsp; I must sleep on it 
before I write!&rsquo;&nbsp; She took up the novel she had been 
reading in the afternoon, and read on at it steadily till her 
bedtime.</p>
<p>That night she did not sleep.&nbsp; It was not that she was 
agitated.&nbsp; Indeed, she was more at ease than she had been 
for days; she had after much anxious thought made up her mind to 
a definite course of action.&nbsp; Therefore her sleeplessness 
was not painful.&nbsp; It was rather that she did not want to 
sleep, than that she could not.&nbsp; She lay still, thinking, 
thinking; dreaming such dreams as are the occasions of sanctified
privacy to her age and sex.</p>
<p>In the morning she was no worse for her vigil.&nbsp; When at 
luncheon-time Aunt Laetitia had returned she went into all the 
little matters of which she had to report.&nbsp; It was after 
tea-time when she found herself alone, and with leisure to attend
to what was, she felt, directly her own affair.&nbsp; During the 
night she had made up her mind exactly what to say to Leonard; 
and as her specific resolution bore the test of daylight she was 
satisfied.&nbsp; The opening words had in their inception caused 
her some concern; but after hours of thought she had come to the 
conclusion that to address, under the circumstance, the recipient
of the letter as &lsquo;Dear Mr. Everard&rsquo; would hardly 
do.&nbsp; The only possible justification of her unconventional 
act was that there existed already a friendship, an intimacy of 
years, since childhood; that there were already between them 
knowledge and understanding of each other; that what she was 
doing, and about to do, was but a further step in a series of 
events long ago undertaken.</p>
<p>She thought it better to send by post rather than messenger, 
as the latter did away with all privacy with regard to the 
act.</p>
<p>The letter was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Dear 
Leonard</span>,&mdash;Would it be convenient for you to meet me 
to-morrow, Tuesday, at half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock on the top 
of Caester Hill?&nbsp; I want to speak about a matter that may 
have some interest to you, and it will be more private there than
in the house.&nbsp; Also it will be cooler in the shade on the 
hilltop.&mdash;</p>
<p>Yours sincerely, <span class="smcap">Stephen 
Norman</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having posted the letter she went about the usual routine of 
her life at Normanstand, and no occasion of suspicion or remark 
regarding her came to her aunt.</p>
<p>In her room that night when she had sent away her maid, she 
sat down to think, and all the misgivings of the day came 
back.&nbsp; One by one they were conquered by one protective 
argument:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am free to do as I like.&nbsp; I am my own mistress; 
and I am doing nothing that is wrong.&nbsp; Even if it is 
unconventional, what of that?&nbsp; God knows there are enough 
conventions in the world that are wrong, hopelessly, unalterably 
wrong.&nbsp; After all, who are the people who are most bound by 
convention?&nbsp; Those who call themselves 
&ldquo;smart!&rdquo;&nbsp; If Convention is the god of the smart 
set, then it is about time that honest people chose 
another!&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Leonard received the letter at breakfast-time.&nbsp; He did 
not give it any special attention, as he had other letters at the
same time, some of which were, if less pleasant, of more 
immediate importance.&nbsp; He had of late been bombarded with 
dunning letters from tradesmen; for during his University life, 
and ever since, he had run into debt.&nbsp; The moderate 
allowance his father made him he had treated as cash for 
incidental expenses, but everything else had been on 
credit.&nbsp; Indeed he was beginning to get seriously alarmed 
about the future, for his father, who had paid his debts once, 
and at a time when they were by comparison inconsiderable, had 
said that he would not under any circumstances pay others.&nbsp; 
He was not sorry, therefore, for an opportunity of getting away 
for a few hours from home; from himself&mdash;from anxieties, 
possibilities.&nbsp; The morning was a sweltering one, and he 
grumbled to himself as he set out on his journey through the 
woods.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Stephen rose fresh and in good spirits, despite her sleepless 
night.&nbsp; When youth and strength are to the fore, a 
night&rsquo;s sleep is not of much account, for the system once 
braced up is not allowed to slacken.&nbsp; It was a notable sign 
of her strong nature that she was not even impatient, but waited 
with calm fixity the hour at which she had asked Leonard Everard 
to meet her.&nbsp; It is true that as the time grew closer her 
nerve was less marked.&nbsp; And just before it she was a 
girl&mdash;and nothing more; with all girl&rsquo;s diffidence, a 
girl&rsquo;s self-distrust, a girl&rsquo;s abnegation, a 
girl&rsquo;s plasticity.</p>
<p>In the more purely personal aspect of her enterprise 
Stephen&rsquo;s effort was more conscious.&nbsp; It is hardly 
possible for a pretty woman to seek in her study of perfection 
the aid of her mirror and to be unconscious of her aims.&nbsp; 
There must certainly be at least one dominant purpose: the 
achievement of success.&nbsp; Stephen did not attempt to deny her
own beauty; on the contrary she gave it the fullest scope.&nbsp; 
There was a certain triumph in her glance as she took her last 
look in her mirror; a gratification of her wish to show herself 
in the best way possible.&nbsp; It was a very charming picture 
which the mirror reflected.</p>
<p>It may be that there is a companionship in a mirror, 
especially to a woman; that the reflection of oneself is an 
emboldening presence, a personality which is better than the 
actuality of an unvalued stranger.&nbsp; Certainly, when Stephen 
closed the door and stood in the wainscoted passage, which was 
only dimly lit by the high window at either end, her courage 
seemed at once to ooze away.</p>
<p>Probably for the first time in her life, as she left the shade
of the long passage and came out on the staircase flooded with 
the light of the noonday sun, Stephen felt that she was a 
girl&mdash;&lsquo;girl&rsquo; standing as some sort of synonym 
for weakness, pretended or actual.&nbsp; Fear, in whatever form 
or degree it may come, is a vital quality and must move.&nbsp; It
cannot stand at a fixed point; if it be not sent backward it must
progress.&nbsp; Stephen felt this, and, though her whole nature 
was repugnant to the task, forced herself to the effort of 
repression.&nbsp; It would, she felt, have been to her a 
delicious pleasure to have abandoned all effort; to have sunk in 
the lassitude of self-surrender.</p>
<p>The woman in her was working; her sex had found her out!</p>
<p>She turned and looked around her, as though conscious of being
watched.&nbsp; Then, seeing that she was alone, she went her way 
with settled purpose; with flashing eyes and glowing 
cheeks&mdash;and a beating heart.&nbsp; A heart all woman&rsquo;s
since it throbbed the most with apprehension when the enemy, Man,
was the objective of her most resolute attack.&nbsp; She knew 
that she must keep moving; that she must not stop or pause; or 
her whole resolution must collapse.&nbsp; And so she hurried on, 
fearful lest a chance meeting with any one might imperil her 
purpose.</p>
<p>On she went through the faint moss-green paths; through 
meadows rich with flowering grasses and the many reds of the 
summer wild-flowers.&nbsp; And so up through the path cut in the 
natural dipping of the rock that rose over Caester Hill and 
formed a strong base for the clump of great trees that made a 
landmark for many a mile around.&nbsp; During the first part of 
her journey between the house and the hilltop, she tried to hold 
her purpose at arm&rsquo;s length; it would be sufficient to face
its terrors when the time had come.&nbsp; In the meantime the 
matter was of such overwhelming importance that nothing else 
could take its place; all she could do was to suspend the active 
part of the thinking faculties and leave the mind only 
receptive.</p>
<p>But when she had passed through the thin belt of stunted oak 
and beech which hedged in the last of the lush meadows, and 
caught sight of the clump of trees on the hilltop, she 
unconsciously braced herself as a young regiment loses its 
tremors when the sight of the enemy breaks upon it.&nbsp; No 
longer her eyes fell earthward; they were raised, and raised 
proudly.&nbsp; Stephen Norman was fixed in her intention.&nbsp; 
Like the woman of old, her feet were on the ploughshares and she 
would not hesitate.</p>
<p>As she drew near the appointed place her pace grew slower and 
slower; the woman in her was unconsciously manifesting 
itself.&nbsp; She would not be first in her tryst with a 
man.&nbsp; Unconsciousness, however, is not a working quality 
which can be relied upon for staying power; the approach to the 
trysting-place brought once more home to her the strange nature 
of her enterprise.&nbsp; She had made up her mind to it; there 
was no use in deceiving herself.&nbsp; What she had undertaken to
do was much more unconventional than being first at a 
meeting.&nbsp; It was foolish and weak to delay.&nbsp; The last 
thought braced her up; and it was with a hurried gait, which 
alone would have betrayed her to an intelligent observer, that 
she entered the grove.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE MEETING</h2>
<p>Had Stephen been better acquainted with men and women, she 
would have been more satisfied with herself for being the first 
at the tryst.&nbsp; The conventional idea, in the minds of most 
women and of all men, is that a woman should never be the 
first.&nbsp; But real women, those in whom the heart beats 
strong, and whose blood can leap, know better.&nbsp; These are 
the commanders of men.&nbsp; In them sex calls to sex, all 
unconsciously at first; and men answer to their call, as they to 
men&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Two opposite feelings strove for dominance as Stephen found 
herself on the hilltop, alone.&nbsp; One a feeling natural enough
to any one, and especially to a girl, of relief that a dreaded 
hour had been postponed; the other of chagrin that she was the 
first.</p>
<p>After a few moments, however, one of the two militant thoughts
became dominant: the feeling of chagrin.&nbsp; With a pang she 
thought if she had been a man and summoned for such a purpose, 
how she would have hurried to the trysting-place; how the flying 
of her feet would have vied with the quick rapturous beating of 
her heart!&nbsp; With a little sigh and a blush, she remembered 
that Leonard did not know the purpose of the meeting; that he was
a friend almost brought up with her since boy and girl times; 
that he had often been summoned in similar terms and for the most
trivial of social purposes.</p>
<p>For nearly half an hour Stephen sat on the rustic seat under 
the shadow of the great oak, looking, half unconscious of its 
beauty and yet influenced by it, over the wide landscape 
stretched at her feet.</p>
<p>In spite of her disregard of conventions, she was no fool; the
instinct of wisdom was strong within her, so strong that in many 
ways it ruled her conscious efforts.&nbsp; Had any one told her 
that her preparations for this interview were made deliberately 
with some of the astuteness that dominated the Devil when he took
Jesus to the top of a high mountain and showed him all the 
kingdoms of the earth at His feet, she would have, and with 
truth, denied it with indignation.&nbsp; Nevertheless it was a 
fact that she had, in all unconsciousness, chosen for the meeting
a spot which would evidence to a man, consciously or 
unconsciously, the desirability for his own sake of acquiescence 
in her views and wishes.&nbsp; For all this spreading landscape 
was her possession, which her husband would share.&nbsp; As far 
as the eye could reach was within the estate which she had 
inherited from her father and her uncle.</p>
<p>The half-hour passed in waiting had in one way its advantages 
to the girl: though she was still as high strung as ever, she 
acquired a larger measure of control over herself.&nbsp; The 
nervous tension, however, was so complete physically that all her
faculties were acutely awake; very early she became conscious of 
a distant footstep.</p>
<p>To Stephen&rsquo;s straining ears the footsteps seemed 
wondrous slow, and more wondrous regular; she felt instinctively 
that she would have liked to have listened to a more hurried 
succession of less evenly-marked sounds.&nbsp; But 
notwithstanding these thoughts, and the qualms which came in 
their turn, the sound of the coming feet brought great joy.&nbsp;
For, after all, they were coming; and coming just in time to 
prevent the sense of disappointment at their delay gaining firm 
foothold.&nbsp; It was only when the coming was assured that she 
felt how strong had been the undercurrent of her apprehension 
lest they should not come at all.</p>
<p>Very sweet and tender and beautiful Stephen looked at this 
moment.&nbsp; The strong lines of her face were softened by the 
dark fire in her eyes and the feeling which glowed in the deep 
blushes which mantled her cheeks.&nbsp; The proudness of her 
bearing was no less marked than ever, but in the willowy sway of 
her body there was a yielding of mere sorry pride.&nbsp; In all 
the many moods which the gods allow to good women there is none 
so dear or so alluring, consciously as well as instinctively, to 
true men as this self-surrender.&nbsp; As Leonard drew near, 
Stephen sank softly into a seat, doing so with a guilty feeling 
of acting a part.&nbsp; When he actually came into the grove he 
found her seemingly lost in a reverie as she gazed out over the 
wide expanse in front of her.&nbsp; He was hot after his walk, 
and with something very like petulance threw himself into a cane 
armchair, exclaiming as he did so with the easy insolence of old 
familiarity:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a girl you are, Stephen! dragging a fellow all the
way up here.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t you have fixed it down below 
somewhere if you wanted to see me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Strangely enough, as it seemed to her, Stephen did not dislike
his tone of mastery.&nbsp; There was something in it which 
satisfied her.&nbsp; The unconscious recognition of his manhood, 
as opposed to her womanhood, soothed her in a peaceful way.&nbsp;
It was easy to yield to a dominant man.&nbsp; She was never more 
womanly than when she answered him softly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was rather unfair; but I thought you would not mind 
coming so far.&nbsp; It is so cool and delightful here; and we 
can talk without being disturbed.&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard was lying 
back in his chair fanning himself with his wide-brimmed straw 
hat, with outstretched legs wide apart and resting on the back of
his heels.&nbsp; He replied with grudging condescension:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s cool enough after the hot tramp over 
the fields and through the wood.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not so good as 
the house, though, in one way: a man can&rsquo;t get a drink 
here.&nbsp; I say, Stephen, it wouldn&rsquo;t be half bad if 
there were a shanty put up here like those at the Grands Mulets 
or on the Matterhorn.&nbsp; There could be a tap laid on where a 
fellow could quench his thirst on a day like this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before Stephen&rsquo;s eyes floated a momentary vision of a 
romantic ch&acirc;let with wide verandah and big windows looking 
over the landscape; a great wide stone hearth; quaint furniture 
made from the gnarled branches of trees; skins on the floor; and 
the walls adorned with antlers, great horns, and various trophies
of the chase.&nbsp; And amongst them Leonard, in a picturesque 
suit, lolling back just as at present and smiling with a loving 
look in his eyes as she handed him a great blue-and-white Munich 
beer mug topped with cool foam.&nbsp; There was a soft mystery in
her voice as she answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps, Leonard, there will some day be such a place 
here!&rsquo;&nbsp; He seemed to grumble as he replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish it was here now.&nbsp; Some day seems a long way
off!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This seemed a good opening for Stephen; for the fear of the 
situation was again beginning to assail her, and she felt that if
she did not enter on her task at once, its difficulty might 
overwhelm her.&nbsp; She felt angry with herself that there was a
change in her voice as she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some day may mean&mdash;can mean everything.&nbsp; 
Things needn&rsquo;t be a longer way off than we choose 
ourselves, sometimes!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, that&rsquo;s a good one!&nbsp; Do you mean to 
say that because I am some day to own Brindehow I can do as I 
like with it at once, whilst the governor&rsquo;s all there, and 
a better life than I am any day?&nbsp; Unless you want me to 
shoot the old man by accident when we go out on the 
First.&rsquo;&nbsp; He laughed a short, unmeaning masculine laugh
which jarred somewhat on her.&nbsp; She did not, however, mean to
be diverted from her main purpose, so she went on quickly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know quite well, Leonard, that I don&rsquo;t mean 
anything of the kind.&nbsp; But there was something I wanted to 
say to you, and I wished that we should be alone.&nbsp; Can you 
not guess what it is?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I can!&rsquo; was his 
response, lazily given.</p>
<p>Despite her resolution she turned her head; she could not meet
his eyes.&nbsp; It cut her with a sharp pain to notice when she 
turned again that he was not looking at her.&nbsp; He continued 
fanning himself with his hat as he gazed out at the view.&nbsp; 
She felt that the critical moment of her life had come, that it 
was now or never as to her fulfilling her settled 
intention.&nbsp; So with a rush she went on her way:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leonard, you and I have been friends a long time.&nbsp;
You know my views on some points, and that I think a woman should
be as free to act as a man!&rsquo;&nbsp; She paused; words and 
ideas did not seem to flow with the readiness she expected.&nbsp;
Leonard&rsquo;s arrogant assurance completed the dragging her 
back to earth which her own self-consciousness began:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Drive on, old girl!&nbsp; I know you&rsquo;re a crank 
from Crankville on some subjects.&nbsp; Let us have it for all 
you&rsquo;re worth.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m on the grass and 
listening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen paused.&nbsp; &lsquo;A crank from 
Crankville!&rsquo;&mdash;this after her nights of sleepless 
anxiety; after the making of the resolution which had cost her so
much, and which was now actually in process of realisation.&nbsp;
Was it all worth so much? why not abandon it now? . . . Abandon 
it!&nbsp; Abandon a resolution!&nbsp; All the obstinacy of her 
nature&mdash;she classed it herself as firmness&mdash;rose in 
revolt.&nbsp; She shook her head angrily, pulled herself 
together, and went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That may be! though it&rsquo;s not what I call myself, 
or what I am usually called, so far as I know.&nbsp; At any rate 
my convictions are honest, and I am sure you will respect them as
such, even if you do not share them.&rsquo;&nbsp; She did not see
the ready response in his face which she expected, and so hurried
on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has always seemed to me that a&mdash;when a woman 
has to speak to a man she should do so as frankly as she would 
like him to speak to her, and as freely.&nbsp; Leonard, 
I&mdash;I,&rsquo; as she halted, a sudden idea, winged with 
possibilities of rescuing procrastination came to her.&nbsp; She 
went on more easily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you are in trouble about money matters.&nbsp; 
Why not let me help you?&rsquo;&nbsp; He sat up and looked at her
and said genially:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Stephen, you are a good old sort!&nbsp; No 
mistake about it.&nbsp; Do you mean to say you would help me to 
pay my debts, when the governor has refused to do so any 
more?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be a great pleasure to me, Leonard, to do 
anything for your good or your pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a long pause; they both sat looking down at the 
ground.&nbsp; The woman&rsquo;s heart beat loud; she feared that 
the man must hear it.&nbsp; She was consumed with anxiety, and 
with a desolating wish to be relieved from the strain of saying 
more.&nbsp; Surely, surely Leonard could not be so blind as not 
to see the state of things! . . . He would surely seize the 
occasion; throw aside his diffidence and relieve her! . . . His 
words made a momentary music in her ears as he spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is this what you asked me to come here 
for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The words filled her with a great shame.&nbsp; She felt 
herself a dilemma.&nbsp; It had been no part of her purpose to 
allude his debts.&nbsp; Viewed in the light of what was to 
follow, it would seem to him that she was trying to foreclose his
affection.&nbsp;&nbsp; That could not be allowed to pass; the 
error must be rectified.&nbsp; And yet! . . . And yet this very 
error must be cleared up before she could make her full wish 
apparent.&nbsp; She seemed to find herself compelled by 
inexorable circumstances into an unlooked-for bluntness.&nbsp; In
any case she must face the situation.&nbsp; Her pluck did not 
fail her; it was with a very noble and graceful simplicity that 
she turned to her companion and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leonard, I did not quite mean that.&nbsp; It would be a
pleasure to me to be of that or any other service to you, if I 
might be so happy!&nbsp; But I never meant to allude to your 
debts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! Leonard, can&rsquo;t you understand!&nbsp;
If you were my husband&mdash;or&mdash;or going to be, all such 
little troubles would fall away from you.&nbsp; But I would not 
for the world have you think . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>Her very voice failed her.&nbsp; She could not speak what was 
in her mind; she turned away, hiding in her hands her face which 
fairly seemed to burn.&nbsp; This, she thought, was the time for 
a true lover&rsquo;s opportunity!&nbsp; Oh, if she had been a 
man, and a woman had so appealed, how he would have sprung to her
side and taken her in his arms, and in a wild rapture of declared
affection have swept away all the pain of her shame!</p>
<p>But she remained alone.&nbsp; There was no springing to her 
side; no rapture of declared affection; no obliteration of her 
shame.&nbsp; She had to bear it all alone.&nbsp; There, in the 
open; under the eyes that she would fain have seen any other 
phase of her distress.&nbsp; Her heart beat loud and fast; she 
waited to gain her self-control.</p>
<p>Leonard Everard had his faults, plenty of them, and he was in 
truth composed of an amalgam of far baser metals than Stephen 
thought; but he had been born of gentle blood and reared amongst 
gentlefolk.&nbsp; He did not quite understand the cause or the 
amount of his companion&rsquo;s concern; but he could not but 
recognise her distress.&nbsp; He realised that it had followed 
hard upon her most generous intention towards himself.&nbsp; He 
could not, therefore, do less than try to comfort her, and he 
began his task in a conventional way, but with a blundering 
awkwardness which was all manlike.&nbsp; He took her hand and 
held it in his; this much at any rate he had learned in sitting 
on stairs or in conservatories after extra dances.&nbsp; He said 
as tenderly as he could, but with an impatient gesture unseen by 
her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgive me, Stephen!&nbsp; I suppose I have said or 
done something which I shouldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t 
know what it is; upon my honour I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Anyhow, I am
truly sorry for it.&nbsp; Cheer up, old girl!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
your husband, you know; so you needn&rsquo;t be 
distressed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen took her courage <i>&agrave; deux mains</i>.&nbsp; If 
Leonard would not speak she must.&nbsp; It was manifestly 
impossible that the matter could be left in its present 
state.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leonard,&rsquo; she said softly and solemnly, 
&lsquo;might not that some day be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leonard, in addition to being an egotist and the very 
incarnation of selfishness, was a prig of the first water.&nbsp; 
He had been reared altogether in convention.&nbsp; Home life and 
Eton and Christchurch had taught him many things, wise as well as
foolish; but had tended to fix his conviction that affairs of the
heart should proceed on adamantine lines of conventional 
decorum.&nbsp; It never even occurred to him that a lady could so
far step from the confines of convention as to take the 
initiative in a matter of affection.&nbsp; In his blind ignorance
he blundered brutally.&nbsp; He struck better than he knew, as, 
meaning only to pass safely by an awkward conversational corner, 
he replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No jolly fear of that!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re too much of a
boss for me!&rsquo;&nbsp; The words and the levity with which 
they were spoken struck the girl as with a whip.&nbsp; She turned
for an instant as pale as ashes; then the red blood rushed from 
her heart, and face and neck were dyed crimson.&nbsp; It was not 
a blush, it was a suffusion.&nbsp; In his ignorance Leonard 
thought it was the former, and went on with what he considered 
his teasing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes!&nbsp; You know you always want to engineer a 
chap your own way and make him do just as you wish.&nbsp; The man
who has the happiness of marrying you, Stephen, will have a hard 
row to hoe!&rsquo;&nbsp; His &lsquo;chaff&rsquo; with its utter 
want of refinement seemed to her, in her high-strung earnest 
condition, nothing short of brutal, and for a few seconds 
produced a feeling of repellence.&nbsp; But it is in the nature 
of things that opposition of any kind arouses the fighting 
instinct of a naturally dominant nature.&nbsp; She lost sight of 
her femininity in the pursuit of her purpose; and as this was to 
win the man to her way of thinking, she took the logical course 
of answering his argument.&nbsp; If Leonard Everard had purposely
set himself to stimulate her efforts in this direction he could 
hardly have chosen a better way.&nbsp; It came somewhat as a 
surprise to Stephen, when she heard her own words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would make a good wife, Leonard!&nbsp; A husband whom
I loved and honoured would, I think, not be unhappy!&rsquo;&nbsp;
The sound of her own voice speaking these words, though the tone 
was low and tender and more self-suppressing by far than was her 
wont, seemed to peal like thunder in her own ears.&nbsp; Her last
bolt seemed to have sped.&nbsp; The blood rushed to her head, and
she had to hold on to the arms of the rustic chair or she would 
have fallen forward.</p>
<p>The time seemed long before Leonard spoke again; every second 
seemed an age.&nbsp; She seemed to have grown tired of waiting 
for the sound of his voice; it was with a kind of surprise that 
she heard him say:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You limit yourself wisely, Stephen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you mean?&rsquo; she asked, making a great 
effort to speak.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would promise to love and honour; but there 
isn&rsquo;t anything about obeying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke Leonard stretched himself again luxuriously, and 
laughed with the intellectual arrogance of a man who is satisfied
with a joke, however inferior, of his own manufacture.&nbsp; 
Stephen looked at him with a long look which began in 
anger&mdash;that anger which comes from an unwonted sense of 
impotence, and ends in tolerance, the intermediate step being 
admiration.&nbsp; It is the primeval curse that a woman&rsquo;s 
choice is to her husband; and it is an important part of the 
teaching of a British gentlewoman, knit in the very fibres of her
being by the remorseless etiquette of a thousand years, that she 
be true to him.&nbsp; The man who has in his person the necessary
powers or graces to evoke admiration in his wife, even for a 
passing moment, has a stronghold unconquerable as a rule by all 
the deadliest arts of mankind.</p>
<p>Leonard Everard was certainly good to look upon as he lolled 
at his ease on that summer morning.&nbsp; Tall, straight, supple;
a typical British gentleman of the educated class, with all parts
of the body properly developed and held in some kind of suitable 
poise.</p>
<p>As Stephen looked, the anxiety and chagrin which tormented her
seemed to pass.&nbsp; She realised that here was a nature 
different from her own, and which should be dealt with in a way 
unsuitable to herself; and the conviction seemed to make the 
action which it necessitated more easy as well as more natural to
her.&nbsp; Perhaps for the first time in her life Stephen 
understood that it may be necessary to apply to individuals a 
standard of criticism unsuitable to self-judgment.&nbsp; Her 
recognition might have been summed up in the thought which ran 
through her mind:</p>
<p>&lsquo;One must be a little lenient with a man one 
loves!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen, when once she had allowed the spirit of toleration to
work within her, felt immediately its calming influence.&nbsp; It
was with brighter thoughts and better humour that she went on 
with her task.&nbsp; A task only, it seemed now; a means to an 
end which she desired.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leonard, tell me seriously, why do you think I gave you
the trouble of coming out here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Upon my soul, Stephen, I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to care either, lolling like that 
when I am serious!&rsquo;&nbsp; The words were acid, but the tone
was soft and friendly, familiar and genuine, putting quite a 
meaning of its own on them.&nbsp; Leonard looked at her 
indolently:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I like to loll.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But can&rsquo;t you even guess, or try to guess, what I
ask you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t guess.&nbsp; The day&rsquo;s too hot, and
that shanty with the drinks is not built yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or may never be!&rsquo;&nbsp; Again he looked at her 
sleepily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Never be!&nbsp; Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, Leonard, it may depend on you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right then.&nbsp; Drive on!&nbsp; Hurry up the 
architect and the jerry-builder!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A quick blush leaped to Stephen&rsquo;s cheeks.&nbsp; The 
words were full of meaning, though the tone lacked something; but
the news was too good.&nbsp; She could not accept it at once; she
decided to herself to wait a short time.&nbsp; Ere many seconds 
had passed she rejoiced that she had done so as he went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll give me a say before that husband 
of yours comes along.&nbsp; He might be a blue-ribbonite; and it 
wouldn&rsquo;t do to start such a shanty for rot-gut!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again a cold wave swept over her.&nbsp; The absolute 
difference of feeling between the man and herself; his levity 
against her earnestness, his callous blindness to her purpose, 
even the commonness of his words chilled her.&nbsp; For a few 
seconds she wavered again in her intention; but once again his 
comeliness and her own obstinacy joined hands and took her back 
to her path.&nbsp; With chagrin she felt that her words almost 
stuck in her throat, as summoning up all her resolution she went 
on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would be for you I would have it built, 
Leonard!&rsquo;&nbsp; The man sat up quickly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For me?&rsquo; he asked in a sort of wonderment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Leonard, for you and me!&rsquo;&nbsp; She turned 
away; her blushes so overcame her that she could not look at 
him.&nbsp; When she faced round again he was standing up, his 
back towards her.</p>
<p>She stood up also.&nbsp; He was silent for a while; so long 
that the silence became intolerable, and she spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leonard, I am waiting!&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned round and
said slowly, the absence of all emotion from his face chilling 
her till her face blanched:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would worry about it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen Norman was plucky, and when she was face to face with 
any difficulty she was all herself.&nbsp; Leonard did not look 
pleasant; his face was hard and there was just a suspicion of 
anger.&nbsp; Strangely enough, this last made the next step 
easier to the girl; she said slowly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right!&nbsp; I think I understand!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned from her and stood looking out on the distant 
prospect.&nbsp; Then she felt that the blow which she had all 
along secretly feared had fallen on her.&nbsp; But her pride as 
well as her obstinacy now rebelled.&nbsp; She would not accept a 
silent answer.&nbsp; There must be no doubt left to torture her 
afterwards.&nbsp; She would take care that there was no 
mistake.&nbsp; Schooling herself to her task, and pressing one 
hand for a moment to her side as though to repress the beating of
her heart, she came behind him and touched him tenderly on the 
arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leonard,&rsquo; she said softly, &lsquo;are you sure 
there is no mistake?&nbsp; Do you not see that I am asking 
you,&rsquo; she intended to say &lsquo;to be my husband,&rsquo; 
but she could not utter the words, they seemed to stick in her 
mouth, so she finished the sentence: &lsquo;that I be your 
wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The moment the words were spoken&mdash;the bare, hard, naked, 
shameless words&mdash;the revulsion came.&nbsp; As a lightning 
flash shows up the blackness of the night the appalling truth of 
what she had done was forced upon her.&nbsp; The blood rushed to 
her head till cheeks and shoulders and neck seemed to burn.&nbsp;
Covering her face with her hands she sank back on the seat crying
silently bitter tears that seemed to scald her eyes and her 
cheeks as they ran.</p>
<p>Leonard was angry.&nbsp; When it began to dawn upon him what 
was the purpose of Stephen&rsquo;s speech, he had been 
shocked.&nbsp; Young men are so easily shocked by breaches of 
convention made by women they respect!&nbsp; And his pride was 
hurt.&nbsp; Why should he have been placed in such a ridiculous 
position!&nbsp; He did not love Stephen in that way; and she 
should have known it.&nbsp; He liked her and all that sort of 
thing; but what right had she to assume that he loved her?&nbsp; 
All the weakness of his moral nature came out in his 
petulance.&nbsp; It was boyish that his eyes filled with 
tears.&nbsp; He knew it, and that made him more angry than 
ever.&nbsp; Stephen might well have been at a loss to understand 
his anger, as, with manifest intention to wound, he answered 
her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a girl you are, Stephen.&nbsp; You are always 
doing something or other to put a chap in the wrong and make him 
ridiculous.&nbsp; I thought you were joking&mdash;not a good joke
either!&nbsp; Upon my soul, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve 
done that you should fix on me!&nbsp; I wish to 
goodness&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>If Stephen had suffered the red terror before, she suffered 
the white terror now.&nbsp; It was not injured pride, it was not 
humiliation, it was not fear; it was something vague and terrible
that lay far deeper than any of these.&nbsp; Under ordinary 
circumstances she would have liked to have spoken out her mind 
and given back as good as she got; and even as the thoughts 
whirled through her brain they came in a torrent of vague 
vituperative eloquence.&nbsp; But now her tongue was tied.&nbsp; 
Instinctively she knew that she had put it out of her power to 
revenge, or even to defend herself.&nbsp; She was tied to the 
stake, and must suffer without effort and in silence.</p>
<p>Most humiliating of all was the thought that she must 
propitiate the man who had so wounded her.&nbsp; All love for him
had in the instant passed from her; or rather she realised fully 
the blank, bare truth that she had never really loved him at 
all.&nbsp; Had she really loved him, even a blow at his hands 
would have been acceptable; but now . . .</p>
<p>She shook the feelings and thoughts from her as a bird does 
the water from its wings; and, with the courage and strength and 
adaptability of her nature, addressed herself to the hard task 
which faced her in the immediate present.&nbsp; With eloquent, 
womanly gesture she arrested the torrent of Leonard&rsquo;s 
indignation; and, as he paused in surprised obedience, she 
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will do, Leonard!&nbsp; It is not necessary to say
any more; and I am sure you will see, later on, that at least 
there was no cause for your indignation!&nbsp; I have done an 
unconventional thing, I know; and I dare say I shall have to pay 
for it in humiliating bitterness of thought later on!&nbsp; But 
please remember we are all alone!&nbsp; This is a secret between 
us; no one else need ever know or suspect it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She rose as she concluded.&nbsp; The quiet dignity of her 
speech and bearing brought back Leonard in some way to his sense 
of duty as a gentleman.&nbsp; He began, in a sheepish way, to 
make an apology:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I beg your pardon, Stephen.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But again she held the warning hand:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is no need for pardon; the fault, if there were 
any, was mine alone.&nbsp; It was I, remember, who asked you to 
come here and who introduced and conducted this melancholy 
business.&nbsp; I have asked you several things, Leonard, and one
more I will add&mdash;&rsquo;tis only one: that you will 
forget!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she moved away, her dismissal of the subject was that of an
empress to a serf.&nbsp; Leonard would have liked to answer her; 
to have given vent to his indignation that, even when he had 
refused her offer, she should have the power to treat him if he 
was the one refused, and to make him feel small and ridiculous in
his own eyes.&nbsp; But somehow he felt constrained to silence; 
her simple dignity outclassed him.</p>
<p>There was another factor too, in his forming his conclusion of
silence.&nbsp; He had never seen Stephen look so well, or so 
attractive.&nbsp; He had never respected her so much as when her 
playfulness had turned to majestic gravity.&nbsp; All the boy and
girl strife of the years that had gone seemed to have passed 
away.&nbsp; The girl whom he had played with, and bullied, and 
treated as frankly as though she had been a boy, had in an 
instant become a woman&mdash;and such a woman as demanded respect
and admiration even from such a man.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII&mdash;ON THE ROAD HOME</h2>
<p>When Leonard Everard parted from Stephen he did so with a 
feeling of dissatisfaction: firstly, with Stephen; secondly, with
things in general; thirdly, with himself.&nbsp; The first was 
definite, concrete, and immediate; he could give himself chapter 
and verse for all the girl&rsquo;s misdoing.&nbsp; Everything she
had said or done had touched some nerve painfully, or had 
offended his feelings; and to a man of his temperament his 
feelings are very sacred things, to himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why had she put him in such a ridiculous 
position?&nbsp; That was the worst of women.&nbsp; They were 
always wanting him to do something he didn&rsquo;t want to do, or
crying . . . there was that girl at Oxford.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here he turned his head slowly, and looked round in a furtive 
way, which was getting almost a habit with him.&nbsp; &lsquo;A 
fellow should go away so that he wouldn&rsquo;t have to swear 
lies.&nbsp; Women were always wanting money; or worse: to be 
married!&nbsp; Confound women; they all seemed to want him to 
marry them!&nbsp; There was the Oxford girl, and then the 
Spaniard, and now Stephen!&rsquo;&nbsp; This put his thoughts in 
a new channel.&nbsp; He wanted money himself.&nbsp; Why, Stephen 
had spoken of it herself; had offered to pay his debts.&nbsp; 
Gad! it was a good idea that every one round the countryside 
seemed to know his affairs.&nbsp; What a flat he had been not to 
accept her offer then and there before matters had gone 
further.&nbsp; Stephen had lots of money, more than any girl 
could want.&nbsp; But she didn&rsquo;t give him time to get the 
thing fixed . . . If he had only known beforehand what she wanted
he could have come prepared . . . that was the way with 
women!&nbsp; Always thinking of themselves!&nbsp; And now?&nbsp; 
Of course she wouldn&rsquo;t stump up after his refusing 
her.&nbsp; What would his father say if he came to hear of 
it?&nbsp; And he must speak to him soon, for these chaps were 
threatening to County Court him if he didn&rsquo;t pay.&nbsp; 
Those harpies in Vere Street were quite nasty . . . &rsquo;&nbsp;
He wondered if he could work Stephen for a loan.</p>
<p>He walked on through the woodland path, his pace slower than 
before.&nbsp; &lsquo;How pretty she had looked!&rsquo;&nbsp; Here
he touched his little moustache.&nbsp; &lsquo;Gad!&nbsp; Stephen 
was a fine girl anyhow!&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t for all that red
hair . . . I like &rsquo;em dark better! . . . And her being such
an infernal boss!&rsquo;. . . Then he said unconsciously 
aloud:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I was her husband I&rsquo;d keep her to 
rights!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor Stephen!</p>
<p>&lsquo;So that&rsquo;s what the governor meant by telling me 
that fortune was to be had, and had easily, if a man wasn&rsquo;t
a blind fool.&nbsp; The governor is a starchy old party.&nbsp; He
wouldn&rsquo;t speak out straight and say, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s 
Stephen Norman, the richest girl you are ever likely to meet; why
don&rsquo;t you make up to her and marry her?&rdquo;&nbsp; But 
that would be encouraging his son to be a fortune-hunter!&nbsp; 
Rot! . . . And now, just because she didn&rsquo;t tell me what 
she wanted to speak about, or the governor didn&rsquo;t give me a
hint so that I might be prepared, I have gone and thrown away the
chance.&nbsp; After all it mightn&rsquo;t be so bad.&nbsp; 
Stephen is a fine girl! . . . But she mustn&rsquo;t ever look at 
me as she did when I spoke about her not obeying.&nbsp; I mean to
be master in my own house anyhow!</p>
<p>&lsquo;A man mustn&rsquo;t be tied down too tight, even if he 
is married.&nbsp; And if there&rsquo;s plenty of loose cash about
it isn&rsquo;t hard to cover up your tracks . . . I think 
I&rsquo;d better think this thing over calmly and be ready when 
Stephen comes at me again.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way with 
women.&nbsp; When a woman like Stephen fixes her cold grey on a 
man she does not mean to go asleep over it.&nbsp; I daresay my 
best plan will be to sit tight, and let her work herself up a 
bit.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing like a little wholesome neglect 
for bringing a girl to her bearings!&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>For a while he walked on in satisfied self-complacency.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Confound her! why couldn&rsquo;t she have let me know 
that she was fond of me in some decent way, without all that 
formal theatrical proposing?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a deuced annoying 
thing in the long run the way the women get fond of me.&nbsp; 
Though it&rsquo;s nice enough in some ways while it lasts!&rsquo;
he added, as if in unwilling recognition of fact.&nbsp; As the 
path debouched on the highroad he said to himself half aloud:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, she&rsquo;s a mighty fine girl, anyhow!&nbsp; And
if she is red I&rsquo;ve had about enough of the black! . . . 
That Spanish girl is beginning to kick too!&nbsp; I wish I had 
never come across . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shut up, you fool!&rsquo; he said to himself as he 
walked on.</p>
<p>When he got home he found a letter from his father.&nbsp; He 
took it to his room before breaking the seal.&nbsp; It was at 
least concise and to the point:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The enclosed has been sent to me.&nbsp; You
will have to deal with it yourself.&nbsp; You know my opinion and
also my intention.&nbsp;&nbsp; The items which I have marked have
been incurred since I spoke to you last about your debts.&nbsp; I
shall not pay another farthing for you.&nbsp; So take your own 
course!</p>
<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Jasper Everard</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enclosed was a jeweller&rsquo;s bill, the length and the 
total of which lengthened his face and drew from him a low 
whistle.&nbsp;&nbsp; He held it in his hand for a long time, 
standing quite still and silent.&nbsp; Then drawing a deep breath
he said aloud:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That settles it!&nbsp; The halter is on me!&nbsp; 
It&rsquo;s no use squealing.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s to be a red head
on my pillow! . . . All right!&nbsp; I must only make the best of
it.&nbsp; Anyhow I&rsquo;ll have a good time to-day, even if it 
must be the last!&rsquo;</p>
<p>That day Harold was in Norcester on business.&nbsp; It was 
late when he went to the club to dine.&nbsp; Whilst waiting for 
dinner he met Leonard Everard, flushed and somewhat at uncertain 
in his speech.&nbsp; It was something of a shock to Harold to see
him in such a state.</p>
<p>Leonard was, however, an old friend, and man is as a rule 
faithful to friends in this form of distress.&nbsp; So in his 
kindly feeling Harold offered to drive him home, for he knew that
he could thus keep him out of further harm.&nbsp; Leonard thanked
him in uncertain speech, and said he would be ready.&nbsp; In the
meantime he would go and play billiards with the marker whilst 
Harold was having his dinner.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock Harold&rsquo;s dogcart was ready and he 
went to look for Leonard, who had not since come near him.&nbsp; 
He found him half asleep in the smoking-room, much drunker than 
he had been earlier in the evening.</p>
<p>The drive was fairly long, so Harold made up his mind for a 
prolonged term of uneasiness and anxiety.&nbsp; The cool 
night-air, whose effect was increased by the rapid motion, soon 
increased Leonard&rsquo;s somnolence and for a while he slept 
soundly, his companion watching carefully lest he should sway 
over and fall out of the trap.&nbsp; He even held him up as they 
swung round sharp corners.</p>
<p>After a time he woke up, and woke in a nasty temper.&nbsp; He 
began to find fault in an incoherent way with everything.&nbsp; 
Harold said little, just enough to prevent any cause for further 
grievance.&nbsp; Then Leonard changed and became 
affectionate.&nbsp; This mood was a greater bore than the other, 
but Harold managed to bear it with stolid indifference.&nbsp; 
Leonard was this by time making promises to do things for him, 
that as he was what he called a &lsquo;goo&rsquo; 
fell&rsquo;,&rsquo; he might count on his help and support in the
future.&nbsp; As Harold knew him to be a wastrel, over head and 
ears in debt and with only the succession to a small estate, he 
did not take much heed to his maunderings.&nbsp; At last the 
drunken man said something which startled him so much that he 
instinctively drew himself together with such suddenness as to 
frighten the horse and almost make him rear up straight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Woa!&nbsp; Woa!&nbsp; Steady, boy.&nbsp; Gently!&rsquo;
he said, quieting him.&nbsp; Then turning to his companion said 
in a voice hollow with emotion and vibrant with suppressed 
passion:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What was it you said?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leonard, half awake, and not half of that half master of 
himself, answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I said I will make you agent of Normanstand when I 
marry Stephen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold grew cold.&nbsp; To hear of any one marrying Stephen 
was to him like plunging him in a glacier stream; but to hear her
name so lightly spoken, and by such a man, was a bewildering 
shock which within a second set his blood on fire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; he thundered.&nbsp; &lsquo;You
marry Ste . . . Miss Norman!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not worthy to 
untie her shoe!&nbsp; You indeed!&nbsp; She wouldn&rsquo;t look 
on the same side of the street with a drunken brute like 
you!&nbsp; How dare you speak of her in such a way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Brute!&rsquo; said Leonard angrily, his vanity reaching
inward to heart and brain through all the numbing obstacle of his
drunken flesh.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s brute?&nbsp; Brute 
yourself!&nbsp; Tell you goin&rsquo; to marry Stephen, &rsquo;cos
Stephen wants it.&nbsp; Stephen loves me.&nbsp; Loves me with all
her red head!&nbsp; Wha&rsquo;re you doin&rsquo;!&nbsp; 
Wha!!&rsquo;</p>
<p>His words merged in a lessening gurgle, for Harold had now got
him by the throat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care what you say about that lady! damn 
you!&rsquo; he said, putting his face close the other&rsquo;s 
with eyes that blazed.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare to 
mention her name in such a way, or you will regret it longer than
you can think.&nbsp; Loves you, you swine!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The struggle and the fierce grip on his throat sobered Leonard
somewhat.&nbsp; Momentarily sobbed him to that point when he 
could be coherent and vindictive, though not to the point where 
he could think ahead.&nbsp; Caution, wisdom, discretion, taste, 
were not for him at such a moment.&nbsp; Guarding his throat with
both hands in an instinctive and spasmodic manner he answered the
challenge:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who are you calling swine?&nbsp; I tell you she loves 
me.&nbsp; She ought to know.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t she tell me so 
this very day!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold drew back his arm to strike 
him in the face, his anger too great for words.&nbsp; But the 
other, seeing the motion and in the sobering recognition of 
danger, spoke hastily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keep your hair on!&nbsp; You know so jolly much more 
than I do.&nbsp; I tell you that she told me this and a lot more 
this morning when she asked me to marry her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold&rsquo;s heart grew cold as ice.&nbsp; There is 
something in the sound of a voice speaking truthfully which a 
true man can recognise.&nbsp; Through all Leonard&rsquo;s 
half-drunken utterings came such a ring of truth; and Harold 
recognised it.&nbsp; He felt that his voice was weak and hollow 
as he spoke, thinking it necessary to give at first a sort of 
official denial to such a monstrous statement:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Liar!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m no liar!&rsquo; answered Leonard.&nbsp; He 
would like to have struck him in answer to such a word had he 
felt equal to it.&nbsp; &lsquo;She asked me to marry her to-day 
on the hill above the house, where I went to meet her by 
appointment.&nbsp; Here!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll prove it to you.&nbsp; 
Read this!&rsquo;&nbsp; Whilst he was speaking he had opened the 
greatcoat and was fumbling in the breast-pocket of his 
coat.&nbsp; He produced a letter which he handed to Harold, who 
took it with trembling hand.&nbsp; By this time the reins had 
fallen slack and the horse was walking quietly.&nbsp; There was 
moonlight, but not enough to read by.&nbsp; Harold bent over and 
lifted the driving-lamp next to him and turned it so that he 
could read the envelope.&nbsp; He could hardly keep either lamp 
or paper still, his hand trembled so when he saw that the 
direction was in Stephen&rsquo;s handwriting.&nbsp; He was 
handing it back when Leonard said again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Open it!&nbsp; Read it!&nbsp; You must do so; I tell 
you, you must!&nbsp; You called me a liar, and now must read the 
proof that I am not.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t I shall have to ask
Stephen to make you!&rsquo;&nbsp; Before Harold&rsquo;s mind 
flashed a rapid thought of what the girl might suffer in being 
asked to take part in such a quarrel.&nbsp; He could not himself 
even act to the best advantage unless he knew the truth . . . he 
took the letter from the envelope and held it before the lamp, 
the paper fluttering as though in a breeze from the trembling of 
his hand.&nbsp; Leonard looked on, the dull glare of his eyes 
brightening with malignant pleasure as he beheld the 
other&rsquo;s concern.&nbsp; He owed him a grudge, and by God he 
would pay it.&nbsp; Had he not been 
struck&mdash;throttled&mdash;called a liar! . . .</p>
<p>As he read the words Harold&rsquo;s face cleared.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Why, you infernal young scoundrel!&rsquo; he said angrily,
&lsquo;that letter is nothing but a simple note from a young girl
to an old friend&mdash;playmate asking him to come to see her 
about some trivial thing.&nbsp; And you construe it into a 
proposal of marriage.&nbsp; You hound!&rsquo;&nbsp; He held the 
letter whilst he spoke, heedless of the outstretched hand of the 
other waiting to take it back.&nbsp; There was a dangerous 
glitter in Leonard&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; He knew his man and he 
knew the truth of what he had himself said, and he felt, with all
the strength of his base soul, how best he could torture 
him.&nbsp; In the very strength of Harold&rsquo;s anger, in the 
poignancy of his concern, in the relief to his soul expressed in 
his eyes and his voice, his antagonist realised the jealousy of 
one who honours&mdash;and loves.&nbsp; Second by second Leonard 
grew more sober, and more and better able to carry his own idea 
into act.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me my letter!&rsquo; he began.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wait!&rsquo; said Harold as he put the lamp back into 
its socket.&nbsp; &lsquo;That will do presently.&nbsp; Take back 
what you said just now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What?&nbsp; Take back what?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That base lie; that Miss Norman asked you to marry 
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leonard felt that in a physical struggle for the possession of
the letter he would be outmatched; but his passion grew colder 
and more malignant, and in a voice that cut like the hiss of a 
snake he spoke slowly and deliberately.&nbsp; He was all sober 
now; the drunkenness of brain and blood was lost, for the time, 
in the strength of his cold passion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true.&nbsp; By God it is true; every word of 
it!&nbsp; That letter, which you want to steal, is only a proof 
that I went to meet her on Caester Hill by her own 
appointment.&nbsp; When I got there, she was waiting for 
me.&nbsp; She began to talk about a ch&acirc;let there, and at 
first I didn&rsquo;t know what she meant&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was such conviction, such a triumphant truth in his 
voice, that Harold was convinced.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; he thundered; &lsquo;stop, don&rsquo;t 
tell me anything.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to hear.&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t want to know.&rsquo;&nbsp; He covered his face with 
his hands and groaned.&nbsp; It was not as though the speaker 
were a stranger, in which case he would have been by now well on 
in his death by strangulation; he had known Leonard all his life,
and he was a friend of Stephen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And he was speaking
truth.</p>
<p>The baleful glitter of Leonard&rsquo;s eyes grew brighter 
still.&nbsp; He was as a serpent when he goes to strike.&nbsp; In
this wise he struck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall not stop.&nbsp; I shall go on and tell you all 
I choose.&nbsp; You have called me liar&mdash;twice.&nbsp; You 
have also called me other names.&nbsp; Now you shall hear the 
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.&nbsp; And if 
you won&rsquo;t listen to me some one else will.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Harold groaned again; Leonard&rsquo;s eyes brightened still more,
and the evil smile on his face grew broader as he began more and 
more to feel his power.&nbsp; He went on to speak with a cold 
deliberate malignancy, but instinctively so sticking to absolute 
truth that he could trust himself to hurt most.&nbsp; The other 
listened, cold at heart and physically; his veins and arteries 
seemed stagnant.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t tell you anything of her pretty 
embarrassments; how her voice fell as she pleaded; how she 
blushed and stammered.&nbsp; Why, even I, who am used to women 
and their pretty ways and their passions and their flushings and 
their stormy upbraidings, didn&rsquo;t quite know for a while 
what she was driving at.&nbsp; So at last she spoke out pretty 
plainly, and told me what a fond wife she&rsquo;d make me if I 
would only take her!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold said nothing; he only 
rocked a little as one in pain, and his hands fell.&nbsp; The 
other went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is what happened this morning on Caester Hill 
under the trees where I met Stephen Norman by her own 
appointment; honestly what happened.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t 
believe me now you can ask Stephen.&nbsp; My Stephen!&rsquo; he 
added in a final burst of venom as in a gleam of moonlight 
through a rift in the shadowy wood he saw the ghastly pallor of 
Harold&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Then he added abruptly as he held out 
his hand:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now give me my letter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the last few seconds Harold had been thinking.&nbsp; And as
he had been thinking for the good, the safety, of Stephen, his 
thoughts flew swift and true.&nbsp; This man&rsquo;s very tone, 
the openness of his malignity, the underlying scorn when he spoke
of her whom others worshipped, showed him the danger&mdash;the 
terrible immediate danger in which she stood from such a 
man.&nbsp; With the instinct of a mind working as truly for the 
woman he loved as the needle does to the Pole he spoke quietly, 
throwing a sneer into the tone so as to exasperate his 
companion&mdash;it was brain against brain now, and for 
Stephen&rsquo;s sake:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And of course you accepted.&nbsp; You naturally 
would!&rsquo;&nbsp; The other fell into the trap.&nbsp; He could 
not help giving an extra dig to his opponent by proving him once 
more in the wrong.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no, I didn&rsquo;t!&nbsp; Stephen is a fine girl; 
but she wants taking down a bit.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s too high and 
mighty just at present, and wants to boss a chap too much.&nbsp; 
I mean to be master in my own house; and she&rsquo;s got to begin
as she will have to go on.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll let her wait a bit: 
and then I&rsquo;ll yield by degrees to her lovemaking.&nbsp; 
She&rsquo;s a fine girl, for all her red head; and she 
won&rsquo;t be so bad after all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold listened, chilled into still and silent 
amazement.&nbsp; To hear Stephen spoken of in such a way appalled
him.&nbsp; She of all women! . . . Leonard never knew how near 
sudden death he was, as he lay back in his seat, his eyes getting
dull again and his chin sinking.&nbsp; The drunkenness which had 
been arrested by his passion was reasserting itself.&nbsp; Harold
saw his state in time and arrested his own movement to take him 
by the throat and dash him to the ground.&nbsp; Even as he looked
at him in scornful hate, the cart gave a lurch and Leonard fell 
forward.&nbsp; Instinctively Harold swept an arm round him and 
held him up.&nbsp; As he did so the unconsciousness of arrested 
sleep came; Leonard&rsquo;s chin sank on his breast and he 
breathed stertorously.</p>
<p>As he drove on, Harold&rsquo;s thoughts circled in a 
tumult.&nbsp; Vague ideas of extreme measures which he ought to 
take flashed up and paled away.&nbsp; Intention revolved upon 
itself till its weak side was exposed, and, it was 
abandoned.&nbsp; He could not doubt the essential truth of 
Leonard&rsquo;s statement regarding the proposal of 
marriage.&nbsp; He did not understand this nor did he try 
to.&nbsp; His own love for the girl and the bitter awaking to its
futility made him so hopeless that in his own desolation all the 
mystery of her doing and the cause of it was merged and lost.</p>
<p>His only aim and purpose now was her safety.&nbsp; One thing 
at least he could do: by fair means or foul stop Leonard&rsquo;s 
mouth, so that others need not know her shame!&nbsp; He groaned 
aloud as the thought came to him.&nbsp; Beyond this first step he
could do nothing, think of nothing as yet.&nbsp; And he could not
take this first step till Leonard had so far sobered that he 
could understand.</p>
<p>And so waiting for that time to come, he drove on through the 
silent night.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;HAROLD&rsquo;S RESOLVE</h2>
<p>As they went on their way Harold noticed that Leonard&rsquo;s 
breathing became more regular, as in honest sleep.&nbsp; He 
therefore drove slowly so that the other might be sane again 
before they should arrive at the gate of his father&rsquo;s 
place; he had something of importance to say before they should 
part.</p>
<p>Seeing him sleeping so peacefully, Harold passed a strap round
him to prevent him falling from his seat.&nbsp; Then he could let
his thoughts run more freely.&nbsp; Her safety was his immediate 
concern; again and again he thought over what he should say to 
Leonard to ensure his silence.</p>
<p>Whilst he was pondering with set brows, he was startled by 
Leonard&rsquo;s voice at his side:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that you, Harold?&nbsp; I must have been 
asleep!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold remained silent, amazed at the 
change.&nbsp; Leonard went on, quite awake and coherent:</p>
<p>&lsquo;By George!&nbsp; I must have been pretty well 
cut.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember a thing after coming down the 
stairs of the club and you and the hall-porter helping me up 
here.&nbsp; I say, old chap, you have strapped me up all safe and
tight.&nbsp; It was good of you to take charge of me.&nbsp; I 
hope I haven&rsquo;t been a beastly nuisance!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold
answered grimly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t exactly what I should have called 
it!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, after looking keenly at his companion, he 
said: &lsquo;Are you quite awake and sober now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite.&rsquo;&nbsp; The answer came defiantly; there 
was something in his questioner&rsquo;s tone which was militant 
and aggressive.&nbsp; Before speaking further Harold pulled up 
the horse.&nbsp; They were now crossing bare moorland, where 
anything within a mile could have easily been seen.&nbsp; They 
were quite alone, and would be undisturbed.&nbsp; Then he turned 
to his companion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You talked a good deal in your drunken sleep&mdash;if 
sleep it was.&nbsp; You appeared to be awake!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Leonard answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t remember anything of it.&nbsp; What did I
say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am going to tell you.&nbsp; You said something so 
strange and so wrong that you must answer for it.&nbsp; But first
I must know its truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Must!&nbsp; You are pretty dictatorial,&rsquo; said 
Leonard angrily.&nbsp; &lsquo;Must answer for it!&nbsp; What do 
you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you on Caester Hill to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s that to you?&rsquo;&nbsp; There was no 
mistaking the defiant, quarrelsome intent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Answer me! were you?&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold&rsquo;s voice 
was strong and calm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What if I was?&nbsp; It is none of your affair.&nbsp; 
Did I say anything in what you have politely called my drunken 
sleep?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did I say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall tell you in time.&nbsp; But I must know the 
truth as I proceed.&nbsp; There is some one else concerned in 
this, and I must know as I go on.&nbsp; You can easily judge by 
what I say if I am right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then ask away and be damned to you!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Harold&rsquo;s calm voice seemed to quell the other&rsquo;s 
turbulence as he went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you on Caester Hill this morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you meet Miss --- a lady there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What . . . I did!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was it by appointment?&rsquo;&nbsp; Some sort of idea 
or half-recollection seemed to come to Leonard; he fumbled half 
consciously in his breast-pocket.&nbsp; Then he broke out 
angrily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have taken my letter!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know the answer to that question,&rsquo; said Harold 
slowly.&nbsp; &lsquo;You showed me the letter yourself, and 
insisted on my reading it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard&rsquo;s heart 
began to quail.&nbsp; He seemed to have an instinctive dread of 
what was coming.&nbsp; Harold went on calmly and 
remorselessly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did a proposal of marriage pass between you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;&nbsp; The answer was defiantly given; 
Leonard began to feel that his back was against the wall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who made it?&rsquo;&nbsp; The answer was a sudden 
attempt at a blow, but Harold struck down his hand in time and 
held it.&nbsp; Leonard, though a fairly strong man, was powerless
in that iron grasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must answer!&nbsp; It is necessary that I know the 
truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why must you?&nbsp; What have you to do with it?&nbsp; 
You are not my keeper!&nbsp; Nor Stephen&rsquo;s; though I dare 
say you would like to be!&rsquo;&nbsp; The insult cooled 
Harold&rsquo;s rising passion, even whilst it wrung his 
heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have to do with it because I choose.&nbsp; You may 
find the answer if you wish in your last insult!&nbsp; Now, 
clearly understand me, Leonard Everard.&nbsp; You know me of old;
and you know that what I say I shall do.&nbsp; One way or 
another, your life or mine may hang on your answers to 
me&mdash;if necessary!&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard felt himself pulled 
up.&nbsp; He knew well the strength and purpose of the man.&nbsp;
With a light laugh, which he felt to be, as it was, hollow, he 
answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, schoolmaster, as you are asking questions, I 
suppose I may as well answer them.&nbsp; Go on!&nbsp; 
Next!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold went on in the same calm, cold 
voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who made the proposal of marriage?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did . . . Was it made at once and directly, or after 
some preliminary suggestion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;After a bit.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t quite understand at 
first what she was driving at.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was a long 
pause.&nbsp; With an effort Harold went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you accept?&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard hesitated.&nbsp; 
With a really wicked scowl he eyed his big, powerfully-built 
companion, who still had his hand as in a vice.&nbsp; Then seeing
no resource, he answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did not!&nbsp; That does not mean that I won&rsquo;t,
though!&rsquo; he added defiantly.&nbsp; To his surprise Harold 
suddenly released his hand.&nbsp; There was a grimness in his 
tone as he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That will do!&nbsp; I know now that you have spoken the
truth, sober as well as drunk.&nbsp; You need say no more.&nbsp; 
I know the rest.&nbsp; Most men&mdash;even brutes like you, if 
there are any&mdash;would have been ashamed even to think the 
things you said, said openly to me, you hound.&nbsp; You vile, 
traitorous, mean-souled hound!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did I say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what you said; and I shall not forget 
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; He went on, his voice deepening into a stern 
judicial utterance, as though he were pronouncing a sentence of 
death:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leonard Everard, you have treated vilely a lady whom I 
love and honour more than I love my own soul.&nbsp; You have 
insulted her to her face and behind her back.&nbsp; You have made
such disloyal reference to her and to her mad act in so trusting 
you, and have so shown your intention of causing, intentionally 
or unintentionally, woe to her, that I tell you here and now that
you hold henceforth your life in your hand.&nbsp; If you ever 
mention to a living soul what you have told me twice to-night, 
even though you should be then her husband; if you should cause 
her harm though she should then be your wife; if you should cause
her dishonour in public or in private, I shall kill you.&nbsp; So
help me God!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not a word more did he say; but, taking up the reins, drove on
in silence till they arrived at the gate of Brindehow, where he 
signed to him to alight.</p>
<p>He drove off in silence.</p>
<p>When he arrived at his own house he sent the servant to bed, 
and then went to his study, where he locked himself in.&nbsp; 
Then, and then only, did he permit his thoughts to have full 
range.&nbsp; For the first time since the blow had fallen he 
looked straight in the face the change in his own life.&nbsp; He 
had loved Stephen so long and so honestly that it seemed to him 
now as if that love had been the very foundation of his 
life.&nbsp; He could not remember a time when he had not loved 
her; away back to the time when he, a big boy, took her, a little
girl, under his care, and devoted himself to her.&nbsp; He had 
grown into the belief that so strong and so consistent an 
affection, though he had never spoken it or even hinted at it or 
inferred it, had become a part of her life as well as of his 
own.&nbsp; And this was the end of that dreaming!&nbsp; Not only 
did she not care for him, but found herself with a heart so empty
that she needs must propose marriage to another man!&nbsp; There 
was surely something, more than at present he knew of or could 
understand, behind such an act done by her.&nbsp; Why should she 
ask Everard to marry her?&nbsp; Why should she ask any man?&nbsp;
Women didn&rsquo;t do such things! . . . Here he paused.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Women didn&rsquo;t do such things.&rsquo;&nbsp; All at 
once there came back to him fragments of discussions&mdash;in 
which Stephen had had a part, in which matters of convention had 
been dealt with.&nbsp; Out of these dim and shattered memories 
came a comfort to his heart, though his brain could not as yet 
grasp the reason of it.&nbsp; He knew that Stephen had held an 
unconventional idea as to the equality of the sexes.&nbsp; Was it
possible that she was indeed testing one of her theories?</p>
<p>The idea stirred him so that he could not remain quiet.&nbsp; 
He stood up, and walked the room.&nbsp; Somehow he felt light 
beginning to dawn, though he could not tell its source, or guess 
at the final measure of its fulness.&nbsp; The fact of Stephen 
having done such a thing was hard to bear; but it was harder to 
think that she should have done such a thing without a motive; or
worse: with love of Leonard as a motive!&nbsp; He shuddered as he
paused.&nbsp; She could not love such a man.&nbsp; It was 
monstrous!&nbsp; And yet she had done this thing . . . &lsquo;Oh,
if she had had any one to advise her, to restrain her!&nbsp; But 
she had no mother!&nbsp; No mother!&nbsp; Poor 
Stephen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The pity of it, not for himself but for the woman he loved, 
overcame him.&nbsp; Sitting down heavily before his desk, he put 
his face on his hands, and his great shoulders shook.</p>
<p>Long, long after the violence of his emotion had passed, he 
sat there motionless, thinking with all the power and sincerity 
he knew; thinking for Stephen&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>When a strong man thinks unselfishly some good may come out of
it.&nbsp; He may blunder; but the conclusion of his reasoning 
must be in the main right.&nbsp; So it was with Harold.&nbsp; He 
knew that he was ignorant of women, and of woman&rsquo;s nature, 
as distinguished from man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The only woman he had 
ever known well was Stephen; and she in her youth and in her 
ignorance of the world and herself was hardly sufficient to 
supply to him data for his present needs.&nbsp; To a clean-minded
man of his age a woman is something divine.&nbsp; It is only when
in later life disappointment and experience have hammered bitter 
truth into his brain, that he begins to realise that woman is not
angelic but human.&nbsp; When he knows more, and finds that she 
is like himself, human and limited but with qualities of purity 
and sincerity and endurance which put his own to shame, he 
realises how much better a helpmate she is for man than could be 
the vague, unreal creations of his dreams.&nbsp; And then he can 
thank God for His goodness that when He might have given us 
Angels He did give us women!</p>
<p>Of one thing, despite the seeming of facts, he was sure: 
Stephen did not love Leonard.&nbsp; Every fibre of his being 
revolted at the thought.&nbsp; She of so high a nature; he of so 
low.&nbsp; She so noble; he so mean.&nbsp; Bah! the belief was 
impossible.</p>
<p>Impossible!&nbsp; Herein was the manifestation of his 
ignorance; anything is possible where love is concerned!&nbsp; It
was characteristic of the man that in his mind he had abandoned, 
for the present at all events, his own pain.&nbsp; He still loved
Stephen with all the strength of his nature, but for him the 
selfish side ceased to exist.&nbsp; He was trying to serve 
Stephen; and every other thought had to give way.&nbsp; He had 
been satisfied that in a manner she loved him in some way and in 
some degree; and he had hoped that in the fulness of time the 
childish love would ripen, so that in the end would come a mutual
affection which was of the very essence of Heaven.&nbsp; He 
believed still that she loved him in some way; but the future 
that was based on hope had now been wiped out with a sudden and 
unsparing hand.&nbsp; She had actually proposed marriage to 
another man.&nbsp; If the idea of a marriage with him had ever 
crossed her mind she could have had no doubt of her feeling 
toward another. . . . And yet?&nbsp; And yet he could not believe
that she loved Leonard; not even if all trains of reasoning 
should end by leading to that point.&nbsp; One thing he had at 
present to accept, that whatever might be the measure of 
affection Stephen might have for him, it was not love as he 
understood it.&nbsp; He resolutely turned his back on the thought
of his own side of the matter, and tried to find some 
justification of Stephen&rsquo;s act.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seek and ye shall find; knock and it shall be opened to
ye&rsquo; has perhaps a general as well as a special 
significance.&nbsp; It is by patient tireless seeking that many a
precious thing has been found.&nbsp; It was after many a long 
cycle of thought that the seeking and the knocking had effectual 
result.&nbsp; Harold came to believe, vaguely at first but more 
definitely as the evidence nucleated, that Stephen&rsquo;s act 
was due to some mad girlish wish to test her own theory; to prove
to herself the correctness of her own reasoning, the fixity of 
her own purpose.&nbsp; He did not go on analysing further; for as
he walked the room with a portion of the weight taken from his 
heart he noticed that the sky was beginning to quicken.&nbsp; The
day would soon be upon him, and there was work to be done.&nbsp; 
Instinctively he knew that there was trouble in store for 
Stephen, and he felt that in such an hour he should be near 
her.&nbsp; All her life she had been accustomed to him.&nbsp; In 
her sorrows to confide in him, to tell him her troubles so that 
they might dwindle and pass away; to enhance her pleasures by 
making him a sharer in them.</p>
<p>Harold was inspirited by the coming of the new day.&nbsp; 
There was work to be done, and the work must be based on 
thought.&nbsp; His thoughts must take a practical turn; what was 
he to do that would help Stephen?&nbsp; Here there dawned on him 
for the first time the understanding of a certain humiliation 
which she had suffered; she had been refused!&nbsp; She who had 
stepped so far out of the path of maidenly reserve in which she 
had always walked as to propose marriage to a man, had been 
refused!&nbsp; He did not, could not, know to the full the 
measure of such humiliation to a woman; but he could guess at any
rate a part.&nbsp; And that guessing made him grind his teeth in 
impotent rage.</p>
<p>But out of that rage came an inspiration.&nbsp; If Stephen had
been humiliated by the refusal of one man, might not this be 
minimised if she in turn might refuse another?&nbsp; Harold knew 
so well the sincerity of his own love and the depth of his own 
devotion that he was satisfied that he could not err in giving 
the girl the opportunity of refusing him.&nbsp; It would be some 
sort of balm to her wounded spirit to know that Leonard&rsquo;s 
views were not shared by all men.&nbsp; That there were others 
who would deem it a joy to serve as her slaves.&nbsp; When she 
had refused him she would perhaps feel easier in her mind.&nbsp; 
Of course if she did not refuse him . . . Ah! well, then would 
the gates of Heaven open . . . But that would never be.&nbsp; The
past could not be blotted out!&nbsp; All he could do would be to 
serve her.&nbsp; He would go early.&nbsp; Such a man as Leonard 
Everard might make some new complication, and the present was 
quite bad enough.</p>
<p>It was a poor enough thing for him, he thought at 
length.&nbsp; She might trample on him; but it was for her 
sake.&nbsp; And to him what did it matter?&nbsp; The worst had 
come.&nbsp; All was over now!</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE BEECH GROVE</h2>
<p>On the morning following the proposal Stephen strolled out 
into a beech grove, some little distance from the house, which 
from childhood had been a favourite haunt of hers.&nbsp; It was 
not in the immediate road to anywhere, and so there was no 
occasion for any of the household or the garden to go through it 
or near it.&nbsp; She did not put on a hat, but took only a 
sunshade, which she used in passing over the lawn.&nbsp; The 
grove was on the side of the house away from her own room and the
breakfast-room.&nbsp; When she had reached its shade she felt 
that at last she was alone.</p>
<p>The grove was a privileged place.&nbsp; Long ago a great 
number of young beeches had been planted so thickly that as they 
grew they shot up straight and branchless in their struggle for 
the light.&nbsp; Not till they had reached a considerable 
altitude had they been thinned; and then the thinning had been so
effected that, as the high branches began to shoot out in the 
freer space, they met in time and interlaced so closely that they
made in many places a perfect screen of leafy shade.&nbsp; Here 
and there were rifts or openings through which the light passed; 
under such places the grass was fine and green, or the wild 
hyacinths in due season tinged the earth with blue.&nbsp; Through
the grove some wide alleys had been left: great broad walks where
the soft grass grew short and fine, and to whose edges came a 
drooping of branches and an upspringing of undergrowth of laurel 
and rhododendron.&nbsp; At the far ends of these walks were 
little pavilions of marble built in the classic style which ruled
for garden use two hundred years ago.&nbsp; At the near ends some
of them were close to the broad stretch of water from whose edges
ran back the great sloping banks of emerald sward dotted here and
there with great forest trees.&nbsp; The grove was protected by a
ha-ha, so that it was never invaded from without, and the 
servants of the house, both the domestics and the gardeners and 
grooms, had been always forbidden to enter it.&nbsp; Thus by long
usage it had become a place of quiet and solitude for the members
of the family.</p>
<p>To this soothing spot had come Stephen in her pain.&nbsp; The 
long spell of self-restraint during that morning had almost 
driven her to frenzy, and she sought solitude as an anodyne to 
her tortured soul.&nbsp; The long anguish of a third sleepless 
night, following on a day of humiliation and terror, had 
destroyed for a time the natural resilience of a healthy 
nature.&nbsp; She had been for so long in the prison of her own 
purpose with Fear as warder; the fetters of conventional life had
so galled her that here in the accustomed solitude of this place,
in which from childhood she had been used to move and think 
freely, she felt as does a captive who has escaped from an 
irksome durance.&nbsp; As Stephen had all along been free of 
movement and speech, no such opportunities of freedom called to 
her.&nbsp; The pent-up passion in her, however, found its own 
relief.&nbsp; Her voice was silent, and she moved with slow 
steps, halting often between the green tree-trunks in the cool 
shade; but her thoughts ran free, and passion found a vent.&nbsp;
No stranger seeing the tall, queenly girl moving slowly through 
the trees could have imagined the fierce passion which blazed 
within her, unless he had been close enough to see her 
eyes.&nbsp; The habit of physical restraint to which all her life
she had been accustomed, and which was intensified by the 
experience of the past thirty-six hours, still ruled her, even 
here.&nbsp; Gradually the habit of security began to prevail, and
the shackles to melt away.&nbsp; Here had she come in all her 
childish troubles.&nbsp; Here had she fought with herself, and 
conquered herself.&nbsp; Here the spirits of the place were with 
her and not against her.&nbsp; Here memory in its second degree, 
habit, gave her the full sense of spiritual freedom.</p>
<p>As she walked to and fro the raging of her spirit changed its 
objective: from restraint to its final causes; and chief amongst 
them the pride which had been so grievously hurt.&nbsp; How she 
loathed the day that had passed, and how more than all she hated 
herself for her part in it; her mad, foolish, idiotic, 
self-importance which gave her the idea of such an act and urged 
her to the bitter end of its carrying out; her mulish obstinacy 
in persisting when every fibre of her being had revolted at the 
doing, and when deep in her inmost soul was a deterring sense of 
its futility.&nbsp; How could she have stooped to have done such 
a thing: to ask a man . . . oh! the shame of it, the shame of it 
all!&nbsp; How could she have been so blind as to think that such
a man was worthy! . . .</p>
<p>In the midst of her whirlwind of passion came a solitary gleam
of relief: she knew with certainty that she did not love Leonard;
that she had never loved him.&nbsp; The coldness of disdain to 
him, the fear of his future acts which was based on disbelief of 
the existence of that finer nature with which she had credited 
him, all proved to her convincingly that he could never really 
have been within the charmed circle of her inner life.&nbsp; Did 
she but know it, there was an even stronger evidence of her 
indifference to him in the ready manner in which her thoughts 
flew past him in their circling sweep.&nbsp; For a moment she saw
him as the centre of a host of besetting fears; but her own sense
of superior power nullified the force of the vision.&nbsp; She 
was able to cope with him and his doings, were there such 
need.&nbsp; And so her mind flew back to the personal side of her
trouble: her blindness, her folly, her shame.</p>
<p>In truth she was doing good work for herself.&nbsp; Her mind 
was working truly and to a beneficent end.&nbsp; One by one she 
was overcoming the false issues of her passion and drifting to an
end in which she would see herself face to face and would place 
so truly the blame for what had been as to make it a warning and 
ennobling lesson of her life.&nbsp; She moved more quickly, 
passing to and fro as does a panther in its cage when the desire 
of forest freedom is heavy upon it.</p>
<p>That which makes the irony of life will perhaps never be 
understood in its casual aspect by the finite mind of man.&nbsp; 
The &lsquo;why&rsquo; and &lsquo;wherefore&rsquo; and the 
&lsquo;how&rsquo; of it is only to be understood by that All-wise
intelligence which can scan the future as well as the present, 
and see the far far-reaching ramifications of those schemes of 
final development to which the manifestation of completed 
character tend.</p>
<p>To any mortal it would seem a pity that to Stephen in her 
solitude, when her passion was working itself out to an end which
might be good, should come an interruption which would throw it 
back upon itself in such a way as to multiply its malignant 
force.&nbsp; But again it is a part of the Great Plan that 
instruments whose use man&rsquo;s finite mind could never 
predicate should be employed: the seeming good to evil, the 
seeming evil to good.</p>
<p>As she swept to and fro, her raging spirit compelling to 
violent movement, Stephen&rsquo;s eyes were arrested by the 
figure of a man coming through the aisles of the grove.&nbsp; At 
such a time any interruption of her passion was a cause for 
heightening anger; but the presence of a person was as a draught 
to a full-fed furnace.&nbsp; Most of all, in her present 
condition of mind, the presence of a man&mdash;for the thought of
a man lay behind all her trouble, was as a tornado striking a 
burning forest.&nbsp; The blood of her tortured heart seemed to 
leap to her brain and to suffuse her eyes.&nbsp; She &lsquo;saw 
blood&rsquo;!</p>
<p>It mattered not that the man whom she saw she knew and 
trusted.&nbsp; Indeed, this but added fuel to the flame.&nbsp; In
the presence of a stranger some of her habitual self-restraint 
would doubtless have come back to her.&nbsp; But now the 
necessity for such was foregone; Harold was her alter ego, and in
his presence was safety.&nbsp; He was, in this aspect, but a 
higher and more intelligent rendering of the trees around 
her.&nbsp; In another aspect he was an opportune victim, 
something to strike at.&nbsp; When the anger of a poison snake 
opens its gland, and the fang is charged with venom, it must 
strike at something.&nbsp; It does not pause or consider what it 
may be; it strikes, though it may be at stone or iron.&nbsp; So 
Stephen waited till her victim was within distance to 
strike.&nbsp; Her black eyes, fierce with passion and 
blood-rimmed as a cobra&rsquo;s, glittered as he passed among the
tree-trunks towards her, eager with his errand of devotion.</p>
<p>Harold was a man of strong purpose.&nbsp; Had he not been, he 
would never have come on his present errand.&nbsp; Never, 
perhaps, had any suitor set forth on his quest with a heavier 
heart.&nbsp; All his life, since his very boyhood, had been 
centred round the girl whom to-day he had come to serve.&nbsp; 
All his thought had been for her: and to-day all he could expect 
was a gentle denial of all his hopes, so that his future life 
would be at best a blank.</p>
<p>But he would be serving Stephen!&nbsp; His pain might be to 
her good; ought to be, to a certain extent, to her mental 
ease.&nbsp; Her wounded pride would find some solace . . . As he 
came closer the feeling that he had to play a part, veritably to 
act one, came stronger and stronger upon him, and filled him with
bitter doubt as to his power.&nbsp; Still he went on 
boldly.&nbsp; It had been a part of his plan to seem to come 
eagerly, as a lover should come; and so he came.&nbsp; When he 
got close to Stephen, all the witchery of her presence came upon 
him as of old.&nbsp; After all, he loved her with his whole soul;
and the chance had come to tell her so.&nbsp; Even under the 
distressing conditions of his suit, the effort had its charm.</p>
<p>Stephen schooled herself to her usual attitude with him; and 
that, too, since the effort was based on truth came with a 
certain ease to her.&nbsp; At the present time, in her present 
frame of mind, nothing in the wide world could give her pleasure;
the ease which came, if it did not change her purpose, increased 
her power.&nbsp; Their usual salutation, begun when she was a 
little baby, was &lsquo;Good morning, Stephen!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Good morning, Harold!&rsquo;&nbsp; It had become so much a
custom that now it came mechanically on her part.&nbsp; The 
tender reference to childhood&rsquo;s days, though it touched her
companion to the quick, did not appeal to her since she had no 
special thought of it.&nbsp; Had such a thought come to her it 
might have softened her even to tears, for Harold had been always
deep in her heart.&nbsp; As might have been expected from her 
character and condition of mind, she was the first to begin:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose you want to see me about something special, 
Harold, you have come so early.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Stephen.&nbsp; Very special!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Were you at the house?&rsquo; she asked in a voice 
whose quietness might have conveyed a warning.&nbsp; She was so 
suspicious now that she suspected even Harold of&mdash;of what 
she did not know.&nbsp; He answered in all simplicity:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No.&nbsp; I came straight here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you know I should be here?&rsquo;&nbsp; Her 
voice was now not only quiet but sweet.&nbsp; Without thinking, 
Harold blundered on.&nbsp; His intention was so single-minded, 
and his ignorance of woman so complete, that he did not recognise
even elementary truths:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I knew you always came here long ago when you were a 
child when you were in&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Here it suddenly 
flashed upon him that if he seemed to expect that she was in 
trouble as he had purposed saying, he would give away his 
knowledge of what had happened and so destroy the work to which 
he had set himself.&nbsp; So he finished the sentence in a lame 
and impotent manner, which, however, saved complete annihilation 
as it was verbally accurate: &lsquo;in short frocks.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Stephen needed to know little more.&nbsp; Her quick intelligence 
grasped the fact that there was some purpose afoot which she did 
not know or understand.&nbsp; She surmised, of course, that it 
was some way in connection with her mad act, and she grew cooler 
in her brain as well as colder in her heart as she prepared to 
learn more.&nbsp; Stephen had changed from girl to woman in the 
last twenty-four hours; and all the woman in her was now 
awake.&nbsp; After a moment&rsquo;s pause she said with a winning
smile:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Harold, I&rsquo;ve been in long frocks for 
years.&nbsp; Why should I come here on this special day on that 
account?&rsquo;&nbsp; Even as she was speaking she felt that it 
would be well to abandon this ground of inquiry.&nbsp; It had 
clearly told her all it could.&nbsp; She would learn more by some
other means.&nbsp; So she went on in a playful way, as a 
cat&mdash;not a kitten&mdash;does when it has got a mouse:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That reason won&rsquo;t work, Harold.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s 
quite rusty in the joints.&nbsp; But never mind it!&nbsp; Tell me
why you have come so early?&rsquo;&nbsp; This seemed to Harold to
be a heaven-sent opening; he rushed in at once:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, Stephen, I wanted to ask you to be my 
wife!&nbsp; Oh! Stephen, don&rsquo;t you know that I love 
you?&nbsp; Ever since you were a little girl!&nbsp; When you were
a little girl and I a big boy I loved you.&nbsp; I have loved you
ever since with all my heart, and soul, and strength.&nbsp; 
Without you the world is a blank to me!&nbsp; For you and your 
happiness I would do anything&mdash;anything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was no acting.&nbsp; When once the barrier of beginning 
had been broken, his soul seemed to pour itself out.&nbsp; The 
man was vibrant through all his nature; and the woman&rsquo;s 
very soul realised its truth.&nbsp; For an instant a flame of 
gladness swept through her; and for the time it lasted put all 
other thought aside.</p>
<p>But suspicion is a hard metal which does not easily yield to 
fire.&nbsp; It can come to white heat easily enough, but its 
melting-point is high indeed.&nbsp; When the flame had leaped it 
had spent its force; the reaction came quick.&nbsp; 
Stephen&rsquo;s heart seemed to turn to ice, all the heat and 
life rushing to her brain.&nbsp; Her thoughts flashed with 
convincing quickness; there was no time for doubting amid their 
rush.&nbsp; Her life was for good or ill at the crossing of the 
ways.&nbsp; She had trusted Harold thoroughly.&nbsp; The habit of
her whole life from her babyhood up had been to so look to him as
comrade and protector and sympathetic friend.&nbsp; She was so 
absolutely sure of his earnest devotion that this new experience 
of a riper feeling would have been a joy to her, if it should be 
that his act was all spontaneous and done in ignorance of her 
shame.&nbsp; &lsquo;Shame&rsquo; was the generic word which now 
summarised to herself her thought of her conduct in proposing to 
Leonard.&nbsp; But of this she must be certain.&nbsp; She could 
not, dare not, go farther till this was settled.&nbsp; With the 
same craving for certainty with which she convinced herself that 
Leonard understood her overtures, and with the same dogged 
courage with which she pressed the matter on him, she now went on
to satisfy her mind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did you do yesterday?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was at Norcester all day.&nbsp; I went early.&nbsp; 
By the way, here is the ribbon you wanted; I think it&rsquo;s 
exactly the same as the pattern.&rsquo;&nbsp; As he spoke he took
a tissue-piper parcel from his pocket and handed it to her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Did you meet any 
friends there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not many.&rsquo;&nbsp; He answered guardedly; he had a 
secret to keep.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where did you dine?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the club!&rsquo;&nbsp; He began to be uneasy at this
questioning; but he did not see any way to avoid answering 
without creating some suspicion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you see any one you knew at the club?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Her voice as she spoke was a little harder, a little more 
strained.&nbsp; Harold noticed the change, rather by instinct 
than reason.&nbsp; He felt that there was danger in it, and 
paused.&nbsp; The pause seemed to suddenly create a new fury in 
the breast of Stephen.&nbsp; She felt that Harold was playing 
with her.&nbsp; Harold!&nbsp; If she could not trust him, where 
then was she to look for trust in the world?&nbsp; If he was not 
frank with her, what then meant his early coming; his seeking her
in the grove; his proposal of marriage, which seemed so sudden 
and so inopportune?&nbsp; He must have seen Leonard, and by some 
means have become acquainted with her secret of shame . . . His 
motive?</p>
<p>Here her mind halted.&nbsp; She knew as well as if it had been
trumpeted from the skies that Harold knew all.&nbsp; But she must
be certain . . . Certain!</p>
<p>She was standing erect, her hands held down by her sides and 
clenched together till the knuckles were white; all her body 
strung high&mdash;like an over-pitched violin.&nbsp; Now she 
raised her right hand and flung it downward with a passionate 
jerk.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Answer me!&rsquo; she cried imperiously.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Answer me!&nbsp; Why are you playing with me?&nbsp; Did 
you see Leonard Everard last night?&nbsp; Answer me, I say.&nbsp;
Harold An Wolf, you do not lie!&nbsp; Answer me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke Harold grew cold.&nbsp; From the question he now 
knew that Stephen had guessed his secret.&nbsp; The fat was in 
the fire with a vengeance.&nbsp; He did not know what to do, and 
still remained silent.&nbsp; She did not give him time to think, 
but spoke again, this time more coldly.&nbsp; The white terror 
had replaced the red:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you not going to answer me a simple question, 
Harold?&nbsp; To be silent now is to wrong me!&nbsp; I have a 
right to know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In his trouble, for he felt that say what he would he could 
only give her new pain, he said humbly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, Stephen!&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you 
understand that I want to do what is best for you?&nbsp; 
Won&rsquo;t you trust me?&rsquo;&nbsp; Her answer came 
harshly.&nbsp; A more experienced man than Harold, one who knew 
women better, would have seen how overwrought she was, and would 
have made pity the pivot of his future bearing and acts and words
while the interview lasted; pity, and pity only.&nbsp; But to 
Harold the high ideal was ever the same.&nbsp; The Stephen whom 
he loved was no subject for pity, but for devotion only.&nbsp; He
knew the nobility of her nature and must trust it to the 
end.&nbsp; When her silence and her blazing eyes denied his 
request, he answered her query in a low voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did!&rsquo;&nbsp; Even whilst he spoke he was 
thankful for one thing, he had not been pledged in any way to 
confidence.&nbsp; Leonard had forced the knowledge on him; and 
though he would have preferred a million times over to be silent,
he was still free to speak.&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s next question 
came more coldly still:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he tell you of his meeting with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he tell you all?&rsquo;&nbsp; It was torture to him
to answer; but he was at the stake and must bear it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think so!&nbsp; If it was true.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did he tell you?&nbsp; Stay!&nbsp; I shall ask you
the facts myself; the broad facts.&nbsp; We need not go into 
details . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Stephen!&rsquo;&nbsp; She silenced his pleading 
with an imperious hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I can go into this matter, surely you can.&nbsp; If 
I can bear the shame of telling, you can at least bear that of 
listening.&nbsp; Remember that knowing&mdash;knowing what you 
know, or at least what you have heard&mdash;you could come here 
and propose marriage to me!&rsquo;&nbsp; This she said with a 
cold, cutting sarcasm which sounded like the rasping of a 
roughly-sharpened knife through raw flesh.&nbsp; Harold groaned 
in spirit; he felt a weakness which began at his heart to steal 
through him.&nbsp; It took all his manhood to bear himself 
erect.&nbsp; He dreaded what was coming, as of old the 
once-tortured victim dreaded the coming torment of the rack.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV&mdash;THE END OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>Stephen went on in her calm, cold voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he tell you that I had asked him to marry 
me?&rsquo;&nbsp; Despite herself, as she spoke the words a red 
tide dyed her face.&nbsp; It was not a flush; it was not a blush;
it was a sort of flood which swept through her, leaving her in a 
few seconds whiter than before.&nbsp; Harold saw and 
understood.&nbsp; He could not speak; he lowered his head 
silently.&nbsp; Her eyes glittered more coldly.&nbsp; The madness
that every human being may have once was upon her.&nbsp; Such a 
madness is destructive, and here was something more vulnerable 
than herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he tell you how I pressed him?&rsquo;&nbsp; There 
was no red tide this time, nor ever again whilst the interview 
lasted.&nbsp; To bow in affirmation was insufficient; with an 
effort he answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understood so.&rsquo;&nbsp; She answered with an icy 
sarcasm:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You understood so!&nbsp; Oh, I don&rsquo;t doubt he 
embellished the record with some of his own pleasantries.&nbsp; 
But you understood it; and that is sufficient.&rsquo;&nbsp; After
a pause she went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did he tell you that he had refused me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold knew now that he was under the
torture, and that there was no refusing.&nbsp; She went on, with 
a light laugh, which wrung his heart even more than her pain had 
done . . . Stephen to laugh like that!</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I have no doubt that he embellished that too, with 
some of his fine masculine witticisms.&nbsp; I understood myself 
that he was offended at my asking him.&nbsp; I understood it 
quite well; he told me so!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then with feminine 
intuition she went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I dare say that before he was done he said something 
kindly of the poor little thing that loved him; that loved him so
much, and that she had to break down all the bounds of modesty 
and decorum that had made the women of her house honoured for a 
thousand years!&nbsp; And you listened to him whilst he 
spoke!&nbsp; Oh-h-h!&rsquo; she quivered with her white-hot 
anger, as the fierce heat in the heart of a furnace 
quivers.&nbsp; But her voice was cold again as she went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But who could help loving him?&nbsp; Girls always 
did.&nbsp; It was such a beastly nuisance!&nbsp; You 
&ldquo;understood&rdquo; all that, I dare say; though perhaps he 
did not put it in such plain words!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the scorn, 
which up to now had been imprisoned, turned on him; and he felt 
as though some hose of deathly chill was being played upon 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And yet you, knowing that only yesterday, he had 
refused me&mdash;refused my pressing request that he should marry
me, come to me hot-foot in the early morning and ask me to be 
your wife.&nbsp; I thought such things did not take place; that 
men were more honourable, or more considerate, or more 
merciful!&nbsp; Or at least I used to think so; till 
yesterday.&nbsp; No! till to-day.&nbsp; Yesterday&rsquo;s doings 
were my own doings, and I had to bear the penalty of them 
myself.&nbsp; I had come here to fight out by myself the battle 
of my shame . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>Here Harold interrupted her.&nbsp; He could not bear to hear 
Stephen use such a word in connection with herself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; You must not say &ldquo;shame.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
There is no shame to you, Stephen.&nbsp; There can be none, and 
no one must say it in my presence!&rsquo;&nbsp; In her secret 
heart of hearts she admired him for his words; she felt them at 
the moment sink into her memory, and knew that she would never 
forget the mastery of his face and bearing.&nbsp; But the 
blindness of rage was upon her, and it is of the essence of this 
white-hot anger that it preys not on what is basest in us, but on
what is best.&nbsp; That Harold felt deeply was her opportunity 
to wound him more deeply than before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even here in the solitude which I had chosen as the 
battleground of my shame you had need to come unasked, unthought 
of, when even a lesser mind than yours, for you are no fool, 
would have thought to leave me alone.&nbsp; My shame was my own, 
I tell you; and I was learning to take my punishment.&nbsp; My 
punishment!&nbsp; Poor creatures that we are, we think our 
punishment will be what we would like best: to suffer in silence,
and not to have spread abroad our shame!&rsquo;&nbsp; How she 
harped on that word, though she knew that every time she uttered 
it, it cut to the heart of the man who loved her.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;And yet you come right on top of my torture to torture me 
still more and illimitably.&nbsp; You come, you who alone had the
power to intrude yourself on my grief and sorrow; power given you
by my father&rsquo;s kindness.&nbsp; You come to me without 
warning, considerately telling me that you knew I would be here 
because I had always come here when I had been in trouble.&nbsp; 
No&mdash;I do you an injustice.&nbsp; &ldquo;In trouble&rdquo; 
was not what you said, but that I had come when I had been in 
short frocks.&nbsp; Short frocks!&nbsp; And you came to tell me 
that you loved me.&nbsp; You thought, I suppose, that as I had 
refused one man, I would jump at the next that came along.&nbsp; 
I wanted a man.&nbsp; God! God! what have I done that such an 
affront should come upon me?&nbsp; And come, too, from a hand 
that should have protected me if only in gratitude for my 
father&rsquo;s kindness!&rsquo;&nbsp; She was eyeing him keenly, 
with eyes that in her unflinching anger took in everything with 
the accuracy of sun-painting.&nbsp; She wanted to wound; and she 
succeeded.</p>
<p>But Harold had nerves and muscles of steel; and when the call 
came to them they answered.&nbsp; Though the pain of death was 
upon him he did not flinch.&nbsp; He stood before her like a 
rock, in all his great manhood; but a rock on whose summit the 
waves had cast the wealth of their foam, for his face was as 
white as snow.&nbsp; She saw and understood; but in the madness 
upon her she went on trying new places and new ways to wound:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You thought, I suppose, that this poor, neglected, 
despised, rejected woman, who wanted so much to marry that she 
couldn&rsquo;t wait for a man to ask her, would hand herself over
to the first chance comer who threw his handkerchief to her; 
would hand over herself&mdash;and her fortune!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Stephen!&nbsp; How can you say such things, think 
such things?&rsquo;&nbsp; The protest broke from him with a 
groan.&nbsp; His pain seemed to inflame her still further; to 
gratify her hate, and to stimulate her mad passion:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did I ever see you at all?&nbsp; Why did my father 
treat you as a son; that when you had grown and got strong on his
kindness you could thus insult his daughter in the darkest hour 
of her pain and her shame!&rsquo;&nbsp; She almost choked with 
passion.&nbsp; There was now nothing in the whole world that she 
could trust.&nbsp; In the pause he spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stephen, I never meant you harm.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t 
speak such wild words.&nbsp; They will come back to you with 
sorrow afterwards!&nbsp; I only meant to do you good.&nbsp; I 
wanted . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; Her anger broke out afresh:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There; you speak it yourself!&nbsp; You only wanted to 
do me good.&nbsp; I was so bad that any kind of a husband . . . 
Oh, get out of my sight!&nbsp; I wish to God I had never seen 
you!&nbsp; I hope to God I may never see you again!&nbsp; 
Go!&nbsp; Go!&nbsp; Go!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was the end!&nbsp; To Harold&rsquo;s honest mind such 
words would have been impossible had not thoughts of truth lain 
behind them.&nbsp; That Stephen&mdash;his Stephen, whose image in
his mind shut out every other woman in the world, past, present, 
and future&mdash;should say such things to any one, that she 
should think such things, was to him a deadly blow.&nbsp; But 
that she should say them to him! . . . Utterance, even the 
utterance which speaks in the inmost soul, failed him.&nbsp; He 
had in some way that he knew not hurt&mdash;wounded&mdash;killed 
Stephen; for the finer part was gone from the Stephen that he had
known and worshipped so long.&nbsp; She wished him gone; she 
wished she had never seen him; she hoped to God never to see him 
again.&nbsp; Life for him was over and done!&nbsp; There could be
no more happiness in the world; no more wish to work, to live! . 
. .</p>
<p>He bowed gravely; and without a word turned and walked 
away.</p>
<p>Stephen saw him go, his tall form moving amongst the tree 
trunks till finally it was lost in their massing.&nbsp; She was 
so filled with the tumult of her passion that she looked, 
unmoved.&nbsp; Even the sense of his going did not change her 
mood.&nbsp; She raged to and fro amongst the trees, her movements
getting quicker and quicker as her excitement began to change 
from mental to physical; till the fury began to exhaust 
itself.&nbsp; All at once she stopped, as though arrested by a 
physical barrier; and with a moan sank down in a helpless heap on
the cool moss.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Harold went from the grove as one seems to move in a 
dream.&nbsp; Little things and big were mixed up in his 
mind.&nbsp; He took note, as he went towards the town by the 
byroads, of everything around him in his usual way, for he had 
always been one of those who notice unconsciously, or rather 
unintentionally.&nbsp; Long afterwards he could shut his eyes and
recall every step of the way from the spot where he had turned 
from Stephen to the railway station outside Norcester.&nbsp; And 
on many and many such a time when he opened them again the 
eyelids were wet.&nbsp; He wanted to get away quickly, silently, 
unobserved.&nbsp; With the instinct of habitual thought his mind 
turned London-ward.&nbsp; He met but few persons, and those only 
cottiers.&nbsp; He saluted them in his usual cheery way, but did 
not stop to speak with any.&nbsp; He was about to take a single 
ticket to London when it struck him that this might look odd, so 
he asked for a return.&nbsp; Then, his mind being once more 
directed towards concealment of purpose, he sent a telegram to 
his housekeeper telling her that he was called away to London on 
business.&nbsp; It was only when he was far on his journey that 
he gave thought to ways and means, and took stock of his 
possessions.&nbsp; Before he took out his purse and pocket-book 
he made up his mind that he would be content with what it was, no
matter how little.&nbsp; He had left Normanstand and all 
belonging to it for ever, and was off to hide himself in whatever
part of the world would afford him the best opportunity.&nbsp; 
Life was over!&nbsp; There was nothing to look forward to; 
nothing to look back at!&nbsp; The present was a living pain 
whose lightest element was despair.&nbsp; As, however, he got 
further and further away, his practical mind began to work; he 
thought over matters so as to arrange in his mind how best he 
could dispose of his affairs, so to cause as little comment as 
might be, and to save the possibility of worry or distress of any
kind to Stephen.</p>
<p>Even then, in his agony of mind, his heart was with her; it 
was not the least among his troubles that he would have to be 
away from her when perhaps she would need him most.&nbsp; And yet
whenever he would come to this point in his endless chain of 
thought, he would have to stop for a while, overcome with such 
pain that his power of thinking was paralysed.&nbsp; He would 
never, could never, be of service to her again.&nbsp; He had gone
out of her life, as she had gone out of his life; though she 
never had, nor never could out of his thoughts.&nbsp; It was all 
over!&nbsp; All the years of sweetness, of hope, and trust, and 
satisfied and justified faith in each other, had been wiped out 
by that last terrible, cruel meeting.&nbsp; Oh! how could she 
have said such things to him!&nbsp; How could she have thought 
them!&nbsp; And there she was now in all the agony of her 
unrestrained passion.&nbsp; Well he knew, from his long 
experience of her nature, how she must have suffered to be in 
such a state of mind, to have so forgotten all the restraint of 
her teaching and her life!&nbsp; Poor, poor Stephen!&nbsp; 
Fatherless now as well as motherless; and friendless as well as 
fatherless!&nbsp; No one to calm her in the height of her wild 
abnormal passion!&nbsp; No one to comfort her when the fit had 
passed!&nbsp; No one to sympathise with her for all that she had 
suffered!&nbsp; No one to help her to build new and better hopes 
out of the wreck of her mad ideas!&nbsp; He would cheerfully have
given his life for her.&nbsp; Only last night he was prepared to 
kill, which was worse than to die, for her sake.&nbsp; And now to
be far away, unable to help, unable even to know how she 
fared.&nbsp; And behind her eternally the shadow of that 
worthless man who had spurned her love and flouted her to a 
chance comer in his drunken delirium.&nbsp; It was too bitter to 
bear.&nbsp; How could God lightly lay such a burden on his 
shoulders who had all his life tried to walk in sobriety and 
chastity and in all worthy and manly ways!&nbsp; It was 
unfair!&nbsp; It was unfair!&nbsp; If he could do anything for 
her?&nbsp; Anything!&nbsp; Anything! . . . And so the unending 
whirl of thoughts went on!</p>
<p>The smoke of London was dim on the horizon when he began to 
get back to practical matters.&nbsp; When the train drew up at 
Euston he stepped from it as one to whom death would be a joyous 
relief!</p>
<p>He went to a quiet hotel, and from there transacted by letter 
such business matters as were necessary to save pain and trouble 
to others.&nbsp; As for himself, he made up his mind that he 
would go to Alaska, which he took to be one of the best places in
the as yet uncivilised world for a man to lose his 
identity.&nbsp; As a security at the start he changed his name; 
and as John Robinson, which was not a name to attract public 
attention, he shipped as a passenger on the <i>Scoriac</i> from 
London to New York.</p>
<p>The <i>Scoriac</i> was one of the great cargo boats which take
a certain number of passengers.&nbsp; The few necessaries which 
he took with him were chosen with an eye to utility in that 
frozen land which he sought.&nbsp; For the rest, he knew nothing,
nor did he care how or whither he went.&nbsp; His vague purpose 
was to cross the American Continent to San Francisco, and there 
to take passage for the high latitudes north of the Yukon 
River.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When Stephen began to regain consciousness her first sensation
was one of numbness.&nbsp; She was cold in the back, and her feet
did not seem to exist; but her head was hot and pulsating as 
though her brain were a living thing.&nbsp; Then her half-open 
eyes began to take in her surroundings.&nbsp; For another long 
spell she began to wonder why all around her was green.&nbsp; 
Then came the inevitable process of reason.&nbsp; Trees!&nbsp; It
is a wood!&nbsp; How did I come here? why am I lying on the 
ground?</p>
<p>All at once wakened memory opened on her its flood-gates, and 
overwhelmed her with pain.&nbsp; With her hands pressed to her 
throbbing temples and her burning face close to the ground, she 
began to recall what she could of the immediate past.&nbsp; It 
all seemed like a terrible dream.&nbsp; By degrees her 
intelligence came back to its normal strength, and all at once, 
as does one suddenly wakened from sleep to the knowledge of 
danger, she sat up.</p>
<p>Somehow the sense of time elapsed made Stephen look at her 
watch.&nbsp; It was half-past twelve.&nbsp; As she had come into 
the grove immediately after breakfast, and as Harold had almost 
immediately joined her, and as the interview between them had 
been but short, she must have lain on the ground for more than 
three hours.&nbsp; She rose at once, trembling in every 
limb.&nbsp; A new fear began to assail her; that she had been 
missed at home, and that some one might have come to look for 
her.&nbsp; Up to now she had not been able to feel the full 
measure of pain regarding what had passed, but which would, she 
knew, come to her in the end.&nbsp; It was too vague as yet; she 
could not realise that it had really been.&nbsp; But the fear of 
discovery was immediate, and must be guarded against without 
delay.&nbsp; As well as she could, she tidied herself and began 
to walk slowly back to the house, hoping to gain her own room 
unnoticed.&nbsp; That her general intelligence was awake was 
shown by the fact that before she left the grove she remembered 
that she had forgotten her sunshade.&nbsp; She went back and 
searched till she had found it.</p>
<p>Gaining her room without meeting any one, she at once change 
her dress, fearing that some soil or wrinkle might betray 
her.&nbsp; Resolutely she put back from her mind all 
consideration of the past; there would be time for that later 
on.&nbsp; Her nerves were already much quieter than they had 
been.&nbsp; That long faint, or lapse into insensibility, had for
the time taken the place of sleep.&nbsp; There would be a price 
to be paid for it later; but for the present it had served its 
purpose.&nbsp; Now and again she was disturbed by one thought; 
she could not quite remember what had occurred after Harold had 
left, and just before she became unconscious.&nbsp; She dared not
dwell upon it, however.&nbsp; It would doubtless all come back to
her when she had leisure to think the whole matter over as a 
connected narrative.</p>
<p>When the gong sounded for lunch she went down, with a calm 
exterior, to face the dreaded ordeal of another meal.</p>
<p>Luncheon passed off without a hitch.&nbsp; She and her aunt 
talked as usual over all the small affairs of the house and the 
neighbourhood, and the calm restraint was in itself 
soothing.&nbsp; Even then she could not help feeling how much 
convention is to a woman&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Had it not been for 
these recurring trials of set hours and duties she could never 
have passed the last day and night without discovery of her 
condition of mind.&nbsp; That one terrible, hysterical outburst 
was perhaps the safety valve.&nbsp; Had it been spread over the 
time occupied in conventional duties its force even then might 
have betrayed her; but without the necessity of nerving herself 
to conventional needs, she would have infallibly betrayed herself
by her negative condition.</p>
<p>After lunch she went to her own boudoir where, when she had 
shut the inner door, no one was allowed to disturb her without 
some special need in the house or on the arrival of 
visitors.&nbsp; This &lsquo;sporting oak&rsquo; was the sign of 
&lsquo;not at home&rsquo; which she had learned in her glimpse of
college life.&nbsp; Here in the solitude of safety, she began to 
go over the past, resolutely and systematically.</p>
<p>She had already been so often over the memory of the previous 
humiliating and unhappy day that she need not revert to it at 
present.&nbsp; Since then had she not quarrelled with Harold, 
whom she had all her life so trusted that her quarrel with him 
seemed to shake the very foundations of her existence?&nbsp; As 
yet she had not remembered perfectly all that had gone on under 
the shadow of the beech grove.&nbsp; She dared not face it all at
once, even as yet.&nbsp; Time must elapse before she should dare 
to cry; to think of her loss of Harold was to risk breaking down 
altogether.&nbsp; Already she felt weak.&nbsp; The strain of the 
last forty-eight hours was too much for her physical 
strength.&nbsp; She began to feel, as she lay back in her 
cushioned chair, that a swoon is no worthy substitute for 
sleep.&nbsp; Indeed it had seemed to make the need for sleep even
more imperative.</p>
<p>It was all too humiliating!&nbsp; She wanted to think over 
what had been; to recall it as far as possible so as to fix it in
her mind, whilst it was still fresh.&nbsp; Later on, some action 
might have to be based on her recollection.&nbsp; And yet . . . 
How could she think when she was so tired . . . tired . . .</p>
<p>Nature came to the poor girl&rsquo;s relief at last, and she 
fell into a heavy sleep . . .</p>
<p>It was like coming out of the grave to be dragged back to 
waking life out of such a sleep, and so soon after it had 
begun.&nbsp; But the voice seemed to reach to her inner 
consciousness in some compelling way.&nbsp; For a second she 
could not understand; but as she rose from the cushions the 
maid&rsquo;s message repeated, brought her wide awake and alert 
in an instant:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Everard, young Mr. Everard, to see you, 
miss!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;A PRIVATE CONVERSATION</h2>
<p>The name braced Stephen at once.&nbsp; Here was danger, an 
enemy to be encountered; all the fighting blood of generations 
leaped to the occasion.&nbsp; The short spell of sleep had helped
to restore her.&nbsp; There remained still quite enough of mental
and nervous excitement to make her think quickly; the words were 
hardly out of the maid&rsquo;s mouth before her resolution was 
taken.&nbsp; It would never do to let Leonard Everard see she was
diffident about meeting him; she would go down at once.&nbsp; But
she would take the precaution of having her aunt present; at any 
rate, till she should have seen how the land lay.&nbsp; Her being
just waked from sleep would be an excuse for asking her aunt to 
see the visitor till she came down.&nbsp; So she said to the 
maid:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been asleep.&nbsp; I must have got tired walking
in the wood in the heat.&nbsp; Ask Auntie to kindly see Mr. 
Everard in the blue drawing-room till I come down.&nbsp; I must 
tidy my hair; but I will be down in a few minutes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shall I send Marjorie to you, miss?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind; I can do what I want 
myself.&nbsp; Hurry down to Miss Rowly!&rsquo;</p>
<p>How she regarded Leonard Everard now was shown in her 
instinctive classing him amongst her enemies.</p>
<p>When she entered the room she seemed all aglow.&nbsp; She 
wanted not only to overcome but to punish; and all the woman in 
her had risen to the effort.&nbsp; Never in her life had Stephen 
Norman looked more radiantly beautiful, more adorable, more 
desirable.&nbsp; Even Leonard Everard felt his pulses quicken as 
he saw that glowing mass of beauty standing out against the cold 
background of old French tapestry.&nbsp; All the physical side of
him leaped in answer to the call of her beauty; and even his cold
heart and his self-engrossed brain followed with slower 
gait.&nbsp; He had been sitting opposite Miss Rowly in one of the
windows, twirling his hat in nervous suspense.&nbsp; He jumped 
up, and, as she came towards him, went forward rapidly to greet 
her.&nbsp; No one could mistake the admiration in his eyes.&nbsp;
Ever since he had made up his mind to marry her she had assumed a
new aspect in his thoughts.&nbsp; But now her presence swept away
all false imaginings; from the moment that her loveliness dawned 
upon him something like love began to grow within his 
breast.&nbsp; Stephen saw the look and it strengthened her.&nbsp;
He had so grievously wounded her pride the previous day that her 
victory on this was a compensation which set her more at her old 
poise.</p>
<p>Her greeting was all sweetness: she was charmed to see 
him.&nbsp; How was his father, and what was the news?&nbsp; Miss 
Rowly looked on with smiling visage.&nbsp; She too had seen the 
look of admiration in his eyes, and it pleased her.&nbsp; Old 
ladies, especially when they are maiden ladies, always like to 
see admiration in the eyes of young men when they are turned in 
the direction of any girl dear to them.</p>
<p>They talked for some time, keeping all the while, by 
Stephen&rsquo;s clever generalship, to the small-talk of the 
neighbourhood and the minor events of social importance.&nbsp; As
the time wore on she could see that Leonard was growing 
impatient, and evidently wanted to see her alone.&nbsp; She 
ignored, however, all his little private signalling, and 
presently ordered tea to be brought.&nbsp; This took some little 
time; when it had been brought and served and drunk, Leonard was 
in a smothered fume of impatience.&nbsp; She was glad to see that
as yet her aunt had noticed nothing, and she still hoped that she
would be able to so prolong matters, that she would escape 
without a private interview.&nbsp; She did not know the cause of 
Leonard&rsquo;s impatience: that he must see her before the day 
passed.&nbsp; She too was an egoist, in her own way; in the flush
of belief of his subjugation she did not think of attributing to 
him any other motive than his desire for herself.&nbsp; As she 
had made up her mind on the final issue she did not want to be 
troubled by a new &lsquo;scene.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, after all, Leonard was a man; and man&rsquo;s ways are 
more direct than woman&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Seeing that he could not 
achieve his object in any other way, he said out suddenly, 
thinking, and rightly, that she would not wish to force an issue 
in the presence of her aunt:</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the way, Miss Norman,&rsquo; he had always called 
her &lsquo;Miss Norman&rsquo; in her aunt&rsquo;s presence: 
&lsquo;I want to have two minutes with you before I go.&nbsp; On 
a matter of business,&rsquo; he added, noticing Miss 
Rowly&rsquo;s surprised look.&nbsp; The old lady was 
old-fashioned even for her age; in her time no young man would 
have asked to see a young lady alone on business.&nbsp; Except on
one kind of business; and with regard to that kind of business 
gentlemen had to obtain first the confidence and permission of 
guardians.&nbsp; Leonard saw the difficulty and said quickly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is on the matter you wrote to me about!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen was prepared for a nasty shock, but hardly for so 
nasty a one as this.&nbsp; There was an indelicacy about it which
went far beyond the bounds of thoughtless conventionality.&nbsp; 
That such an appeal should be made to her, and in such a way, 
savoured of danger.&nbsp; Her woman&rsquo;s intuition gave her 
the guard, and at once she spoke, smilingly and gently as one 
recalling a matter in which the concern is not her own:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course!&nbsp; It was selfish of me not to have 
thought of it, and to have kept you so long waiting.&nbsp; The 
fact is, Auntie, that Leonard&mdash;I like to call him Leonard, 
since we were children together, and he is so young; though 
perhaps it would be more decorous nowadays to say &ldquo;Mr. 
Everard&rdquo;&mdash;has consulted me about his debts.&nbsp; You 
know, Auntie dear, that young men will be young men in such 
matters; or perhaps you do not, since the only person who ever 
worried you has been myself.&nbsp; But I stayed at Oxford and I 
know something of young men&rsquo;s ways; and as I am necessarily
more or less of a man of business, he values my help.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t you, Leonard?&rsquo;&nbsp; The challenge was so 
direct, and the position he was in so daringly put, that he had 
to acquiesce.&nbsp; Miss Rowly, who had looked on with a frown of
displeasure, said coldly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know you are your own mistress, my dear.&nbsp; But 
surely it would be better if Mr. Everard would consult with his 
solicitor or his father&rsquo;s agent, or some of his gentlemen 
friends, rather than with a young lady whose relations with him, 
after all, are only those of a neighbour on visiting terms.&nbsp;
For my own part, I should have thought that Mr. Everard&rsquo;s 
best course would have been to consult his own father!&nbsp; But 
the things that gentlemen, as well as ladies do, have been sadly 
changed since my time!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, rising in formal 
dignity, she bowed gravely to the visitor before leaving the 
room.</p>
<p>But the position of being left alone in the room with Leonard 
did not at all suit Stephen&rsquo;s plans.&nbsp; Rising quickly 
she said to her aunt:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stir, Auntie.&nbsp; I dare say you are 
right in what you say; but I promised Mr. Everard to go into the 
matter.&nbsp; And as I have brought the awkwardness on myself, I 
suppose I must bear it.&nbsp; If Mr. Everard wants to see me 
alone, and I suppose he is diffident in speaking on such a matter
before you&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t play with you, you 
know!&mdash;we can go out on the lawn.&nbsp; We shan&rsquo;t be 
long!&rsquo;&nbsp; Before Leonard could recover his wits she had 
headed him out on the lawn.</p>
<p>Her strategy was again thoroughly good.&nbsp; The spot she 
chose, though beyond earshot, was quite in the open and commanded
by all the windows in that side of the house.&nbsp; A person 
speaking there might say what he liked, but his actions must be 
discreet.</p>
<p>On the lawn Stephen tripped ahead; Leonard followed inwardly 
raging.&nbsp; By her clever use of the opening she had put him in
a difficulty from which there was no immediate means of 
extrication.&nbsp; He could not quarrel overtly with Stephen; if 
he did so, how could he enter on the pressing matter of his 
debts?&nbsp; He dared not openly proclaim his object in wishing 
to marry her, for had he done so her aunt might have interfered, 
with what success he could not be sure.&nbsp; In any case it 
would cause delay, and delay was what he could not afford.&nbsp; 
He felt that in mentioning his debts at just such a movement he 
had given Stephen the chance she had so aptly taken.&nbsp; He had
to be on his good behaviour, however; and with an apprehension 
that was new to him he followed her.</p>
<p>An old Roman marble seat was placed at an angle from the house
so that the one of the two occupants within its curve must almost
face the house, whilst the other gave to it at least a 
quarter-face.&nbsp; Stephen seated herself on the near side, 
leaving to Leonard the exposed position.&nbsp; As soon as he was 
seated, she began:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Leonard, tell me all about the debts?&rsquo;&nbsp;
She spoke in tones of gay friendliness, but behind the mask of 
her cheerfulness was the real face of fear.&nbsp; Down deep in 
her mind was a conviction that her letter was a pivotal point of 
future sorrow.&nbsp; It was in the meantime quite apparent to her
that Leonard kept it as his last resource; so her instinct was to
keep it to the front and thus minimise its power.</p>
<p>Leonard, though inwardly weakened by qualms of growing doubt, 
had the animal instinct that, as he was in opposition, his safety
was in attacking where his opponent most feared.&nbsp; He felt 
that there was some subtle change in his companion; this was 
never the same Stephen Norman whom only yesterday he had met upon
the hill!&nbsp; He plunged at once into his purpose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t about my debts you asked me to meet
you, Stephen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You surprise me, Leonard!&nbsp; I thought I simply 
asked you to come to meet me.&nbsp; I know the first subject I 
mentioned when we began to talk, after your grumbling about 
coming in the heat, was your money matters.&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard 
winced, but went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was very good of you, Stephen; but really that is 
not what I came to speak of to-day.&nbsp; At first, at all 
events!&rsquo; he added with a sublime na&iuml;vett&eacute;, as 
the subject of his debts and his imperative want of money rose 
before him.&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s eyes flashed; she saw more 
clearly than ever through his purpose.&nbsp; Such as admission at
the very outset of the proffer of marriage, which she felt was 
coming, was little short of monstrous.&nbsp; Her companion did 
not see the look of mastery on her face; he was looking down at 
the moment.&nbsp; A true lover would have been looking up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted to tell you, Stephen, that I have been 
thinking over what you said to me in your letter, and what you 
said in words; and I want to accept!&rsquo;&nbsp; As he was 
speaking he was looking her straight in the face.</p>
<p>Stephen answered slowly with a puzzled smile which wrinkled up
her forehead:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Accept what I said in my letter! why, Leonard, what do 
you mean?&nbsp; That letter must have had a lot more in it than I
thought.&nbsp; I seem to remember that it was simply a line 
asking you to meet me.&nbsp; Just let me look at it; I should 
like to be sure of what actually is!&rsquo;&nbsp; As she spoke 
she held out her hand.&nbsp; Leonard was nonplussed; he did not 
know what to say.&nbsp; Stephen made up her mind to have the 
letter back.&nbsp; Leonard was chafing under the position forced 
upon him, and tried to divert his companion from her 
purpose.&nbsp; He knew well why she had chosen that exposed 
position for their interview.&nbsp; Now, as her outstretched hand
embarrassed him, he made reprisal; he tried to take it in his in 
a tender manner.</p>
<p>She instantly drew back her hand and put it behind her in a 
decided manner.&nbsp; She was determined that whatever might 
happen she would not let any watcher at the windows, by chance or
otherwise, see any sign of tenderness on her part.&nbsp; Leonard,
thinking that his purpose had been effected, went on, breathing 
more freely:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your letter wasn&rsquo;t much.&nbsp; Except of course 
that it gave me the opportunity of listening to what you said; to
all your sweet words.&nbsp; To your more than sweet 
proposal!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; It must have been sweet to have any one, who
was in a position to do so, offer to help you when you knew that 
you were overwhelmed with debts!&rsquo;&nbsp; The words were 
brutal.&nbsp; Stephen felt so; but she had no alternative.&nbsp; 
Leonard had some of the hard side of human nature; but he had 
also some of the weak side.&nbsp; He went on blindly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been thinking ever since of what you said, and I
want to tell you that I would like to do as you 
wish!&rsquo;&nbsp; As he spoke, his words seemed even to him to 
be out of place.&nbsp; He felt it would be necessary to throw 
more fervour into the proceedings.&nbsp; The sudden outburst 
which followed actually amused Stephen, even in her state of 
fear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, Stephen, don&rsquo;t you know that I love 
you!&nbsp; You are so beautiful!&nbsp; I love you!&nbsp; I love 
you!&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you be my wife?&rsquo;</p>
<p>This was getting too much to close quarters.&nbsp; Stephen 
said in a calm, business-like way:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Leonard, one thing at a time!&nbsp; I came out 
here, you know, to speak of your debts; and until that is done, I
really won&rsquo;t go into any other matter.&nbsp; Of course if 
you&rsquo;d rather not . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard really could 
not afford this; matters were too pressing with him.&nbsp; So he 
tried to affect a cheery manner; but in his heart was a black 
resolve that she should yet pay for this.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right! Stephen.&nbsp; Whatever you wish I will do; 
you are the queen of my heart, you know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How much is the total amount?&rsquo; said Stephen.</p>
<p>This was a change to the prosaic which made sentiment 
impossible.&nbsp; He gave over, for the time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on!&rsquo; said Stephen, following up her 
advantage.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you even know how much you 
owe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fact is, I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Not exactly.&nbsp; I 
shall make up the amount as well as I can and let you know.&nbsp;
But that&rsquo;s not what I came about to-day.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Stephen was going to make an angry gesture of dissent.&nbsp; She 
was not going to have that matter opened up.&nbsp; She waited, 
however, for Leonard was going on after his momentary 
pause.&nbsp; She breathed more freely after his first 
sentence.&nbsp; He was unable evidently to carry on a double 
train of thought.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was about that infernal money-lenders&rsquo; letter 
that the Governor got!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen got still less 
anxious.&nbsp; This open acknowledgment of his true purpose 
seemed to clear the air.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is the amount?&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard looked quickly
at her; the relief of her mind made her tone seem joyful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A monkey!&nbsp; Five hundred pounds, you know.&nbsp; 
But then there&rsquo;s three hundred for interest that has to be 
paid also.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an awful lot of money, isn&rsquo;t 
it?&rsquo;&nbsp; The last phrase was added on seeing 
Stephen&rsquo;s surprised look.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; she answered quietly.&nbsp; &lsquo;A great 
deal of money&mdash;to waste!&rsquo;&nbsp; They were both silent 
for a while.&nbsp; Then she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does your father say to it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was in an awful wax.&nbsp; One of these beastly duns
had written to him about another account and he was in a regular 
fury.&nbsp; When I told him I would pay it within a week, he said
very little, which was suspicious; and then, just when I was 
going out, he sprung this on me.&nbsp; Mean of him! wasn&rsquo;t 
it?&nbsp; I need expect no help from him.&rsquo;&nbsp; As he was 
speaking he took a mass of letters from his pocket and began to 
look among them for the money-lenders&rsquo; letter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what a correspondence you have there.&nbsp; Do you
keep all your letters in your pockets?&rsquo; said Stephen 
quietly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All I don&rsquo;t tear up or burn.&nbsp; It 
wouldn&rsquo;t do to let the Governor into my secrets.&nbsp; He 
might know too much!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And are all those letters from duns?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mostly, but I only keep those letters I have to attend 
to and those I care for.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Show me the bundle!&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; Then seeing 
him hesitate, added:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know if I am to help you to get clear you must take
me into your confidence.&nbsp; I dare say I shall have to see a 
lot more letters than these before you are quite 
clear!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her tone was too quiet.&nbsp; Knowing already
the silent antagonism between them he began to suspect her; 
knowing also that her own letter was not amongst them, he used 
his wits and handed them over without a word.&nbsp; She, too, 
suspected him.&nbsp; After his tacit refusal to give her the 
letter, she almost took it for granted that it was not amongst 
them.&nbsp; She gave no evidence of her feeling, however, but 
opened and read the letters in due sequence; all save two, which,
being in a female hand, she gave back without a word.&nbsp; There
was a calmness and an utter absence of concern, much less of 
jealousy, about this which disconcerted him.&nbsp; Throughout her
reading Stephen&rsquo;s face showed surprise now and again; but 
when she came to the last, which was that of the usurers, it 
showed alarm.&nbsp; Being a woman, a legal threat had certain 
fears of its own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There must be no delay about this!&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What am I to do?&rsquo; he answered, a weight off his 
mind that the fiscal matter had been practically entered on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall see that you get the money!&rsquo; she said 
quietly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It will be really a gift, but I prefer it 
to be as a loan for many reasons.&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard made no 
comment.&nbsp;&nbsp; He found so many reasons in his own mind 
that he thought it wise to forbear from asking any of hers.&nbsp;
Then she took the practical matter in hand:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must wire to these people at once to say that you 
will pay the amount on the day after to-morrow.&nbsp; If you will
come here to-morrow at four o&rsquo;clock the money will be ready
for you.&nbsp; You can go up to town by the evening train and pay
off the debt first thing in the morning.&nbsp; When you bring the
receipt I shall speak to you about the other debts; but you must 
make out a full list of them.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t have any 
half-measure.&nbsp; I will not go into the matter till I have all
the details before me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she stood up to go.</p>
<p>As they walked across the lawn, she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the way, don&rsquo;t forget to bring that letter 
with you.&nbsp; I want to see what I really did say in 
it!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her tone was quiet enough, and the wording was a
request; but Leonard knew as well as if it had been spoken 
outright as a threat that if he did not have the letter with him 
when he came things were likely to be unpleasant.</p>
<p>The farther he got from Normanstand on his way home the more 
discontented Leonard grew.&nbsp; Whilst he had been in 
Stephen&rsquo;s presence she had so dominated him, not only by 
her personality but by her use of her knowledge of his own 
circumstances, that he had not dared to make protest or 
opposition; but now he began to feel how much less he was to 
receive than he had expected.&nbsp; He had come prepared to allow
Stephen to fall into his arms, fortune and all.&nbsp; But now, 
although he had practical assurance that the weight of his debts 
would be taken from him, he was going away with his tail between 
his legs.&nbsp; He had not even been accepted as a suitor, he who
had himself been wooed only a day before.&nbsp; His proposal of 
marriage had not been accepted, had not even been considered by 
the woman who had so lately broken ironclad convention to propose
marriage to him.&nbsp; He had been treated merely as a scapegrace
debtor who had come to ask favours from an old friend.&nbsp; He 
had even been treated like a bad boy; had been told that he had 
wasted money; had been ordered, in no doubtful way, to bring the 
full schedule of his debts.&nbsp; And all the time he dared not 
say anything lest the thing shouldn&rsquo;t come off at 
all.&nbsp; Stephen had such an infernally masterly way with 
her!&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t matter whether she was proposing to 
him, or he was proposing to her, he was made to feel small all 
the same.&nbsp; He would have to put up with it till he had got 
rid of the debts!</p>
<p>And then as to the letter.&nbsp; Why was she so persistent 
about seeing it?&nbsp; Did she want to get it into her hands and 
then keep it, as Harold An Wolf had done?&nbsp; Was it possible 
that she suspected he would use it to coerce her; she would call 
it &lsquo;blackmail,&rsquo; he supposed.&nbsp; This being the 
very thing he had intended to do, and had done, he grew very 
indignant at the very thought of being accused of it.&nbsp; It 
was, he felt, a very awkward thing that he had lost possession of
the letter.&nbsp; He might need it if Stephen got nasty.&nbsp; 
Then Harold might give it to her, as he had threatened to 
do.&nbsp; He thought he would call round that evening by 
Harold&rsquo;s house, and see if he couldn&rsquo;t get back the 
letter.&nbsp; It belonged to him; Harold had no right to keep 
it.&nbsp; He would see him before he and Stephen got putting 
their heads together.&nbsp; So, on his way home, he turned his 
steps at once to Harold&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>He did not find him in.&nbsp; The maid who opened the door 
could give him no information; all she could say was that Mrs. 
Dingle the housekeeper had got a telegram from Master saying that
he had been called suddenly away on business.</p>
<p>This was a new source of concern to Leonard.&nbsp; He 
suspected a motive of some sort; though what that motive could be
he could not hazard the wildest guess.&nbsp; On his way home he 
called at the post-office and sent a telegram to Cavendish and 
Cecil, the name of the usurers&rsquo; firm, in accordance with 
Stephen&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp; He signed it: &lsquo;Jasper 
Everard.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;A BUSINESS TRANSACTION</h2>
<p>When Stephen had sent off her letter to the bank she went out 
for a stroll; she knew it would be no use trying to get rest 
before dinner.&nbsp; That ordeal, too, had to be gone 
through.&nbsp; She found herself unconsciously going in the 
direction of the grove; but when she became aware of it a great 
revulsion overcame her, and she shuddered.</p>
<p>Slowly she took her way across the hard stretch of finely-kept
grass which lay on the side of the house away from the 
wood.&nbsp; The green sward lay like a sea, dotted with huge 
trees, singly, or in clumps as islands.&nbsp; In its 
far-stretching stateliness there was something soothing.&nbsp; 
She came back to the sound of the dressing-gong with a better 
strength to resist the trial before her.&nbsp; Well she knew her 
aunt would have something to say on the subject of her 
interference in Leonard Everard&rsquo;s affairs.</p>
<p>Her fears were justified, for when they had come into the 
drawing-room after dinner Miss Rowly began:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stephen dear, is it not unwise of you to interfere in 
Mr. Everard&rsquo;s affairs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why unwise, Auntie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear, the world is censorious.&nbsp; And when 
a young lady, of your position and your wealth, takes a part in a
young man&rsquo;s affairs tongues are apt to wag.&nbsp; And also,
dear, debts, young men&rsquo;s debts, are hardly the subjects for
a girl&rsquo;s investigation.&nbsp; Remember, that we ladies live
very different lives from men; from some men, I should say, for 
your dear father was the best of men, and I should think that in 
all his life there was nothing which he would have wished 
concealed.&nbsp; But, my dear, young men are less restrained in 
their ways than we are, than we have to be for our own safety and
protection.&rsquo;&nbsp; The poor lady was greatly perturbed at 
having to speak in such a way.&nbsp; Stephen saw her distress; 
coming over to her, she sat down and took her hand.&nbsp; Stephen
had a very tender side to her nature, and she loved very truly 
the dear old lady who had taken her mother&rsquo;s place and had 
shown her all a mother&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; Now, in her loneliness
and woe and fear, she clung to her in spirit.&nbsp; She would 
have liked to have clung to her physically; to have laid her head
on her bosom, and have cried her heart out.&nbsp; The time for 
tears had not come.&nbsp; Hourly she felt more and more the 
weight that a shameful secret is to carry.&nbsp; She knew, 
however, that she could set her aunt&rsquo;s mind at rest on the 
present subject; so she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you are right, Auntie dear.&nbsp; It would have
been better if I had asked you first; but I saw that Leonard was 
in distress, and wormed the cause of it from him.&nbsp; When I 
heard that it was only debt I offered to help him.&nbsp; He is an
old friend, you know, Auntie.&nbsp; We were children together; 
and as I have much more money than I can ever want or spend, I 
thought I might help him.&nbsp; I am afraid I have let myself in 
for a bigger thing than I intended; but as I have promised I must
go on with it.&nbsp; I dare say, Auntie, that you are afraid that
I may end by getting in love with him, and marrying him.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t you, dear?&rsquo;&nbsp; This was said with a hug and 
a kiss which gave the old lady delight.&nbsp; Her instinct told 
her what was coming.&nbsp; She nodded her head in 
acquiescence.&nbsp; Stephen went on gravely:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Put any such fear out of your mind.&nbsp; I shall never
marry him.&nbsp; I can never love him.&rsquo;&nbsp; She was going
to say &lsquo;could never love him,&rsquo; when she 
remembered.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you sure, my dear?&nbsp; The heart is not always 
under one&rsquo;s own control.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite sure, Auntie.&nbsp; I know Leonard Everard; and 
though I have always liked him, I do not respect him.&nbsp; Why, 
the very fact of his coming to me for money would make me 
reconsider any view I had formed, had nothing else ever done 
so.&nbsp; You may take it, Auntie dear, that in the way you mean 
Leonard is nothing to me; can never be anything to 
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Here a sudden inspiration took her.&nbsp; In its
light a serious difficulty passed, and the doing of a thing which
had a fear of its own became easy.&nbsp; With a conviction in her
tone, which in itself aided her immediate purpose, she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall prove it to you.&nbsp; That is, if you will not
mind doing something which will save me an 
embarrassment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know I will do anything, my dearest, which an old 
woman can do for a young one!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen squeezed the 
mittened hand which she held as she went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;As I said, I have promised to lend him some 
money.&nbsp; The first instalment is to be given him to-morrow; 
he is to call for it in the afternoon.&nbsp; Will you give it to 
him for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gladly, my dear,&rsquo; said the old lady, much 
relieved.&nbsp; Stephen continued:</p>
<p>&lsquo;One other thing, Auntie, I want you to do for me: not 
to think of the amount, or to say a word to me about it.&nbsp; It
is a large sum, and I dare say it will frighten you a 
little.&nbsp; But I have made up my mind to it.&nbsp; I am 
learning a great deal out of this, Auntie dear; and I am quite 
willing to pay for my knowledge.&nbsp; After all, money is the 
easiest and cheapest way of paying for knowledge!&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t you agree with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Rowly gulped down her disappointment.&nbsp; She felt that
she ought not to say too much, now that Stephen had set aside her
graver fears.&nbsp; She consoled herself with the thought that 
even a large amount of money would cause no inconvenience to so 
wealthy a woman as Stephen.&nbsp; Beyond this, as she would have 
the handing over of the money to Leonard, she would know the 
amount.&nbsp; If advisable, she could remonstrate.&nbsp; She 
could if necessary consult, in confidence, with Harold.&nbsp; Her
relief from her greater fear, and her gladness at this new proof 
of her niece&rsquo;s confidence, were manifested in the extra 
affection with which she bade her good-night.</p>
<p>Stephen did not dare to breathe freely till she was quite 
alone; and as she lay quiet in her bed in the dark she thought 
before sleep came.</p>
<p>Her first feeling was one of thankfulness that immediate 
danger was swerving from her.&nbsp; Things were so shaping 
themselves that she need not have any fear concerning 
Leonard.&nbsp; For his own sake he would have to keep 
silent.&nbsp; If he intended to blackmail her she would have the 
protection of her aunt&rsquo;s knowledge of the loan, and of her 
participation in it.&nbsp; The only weapon that remained to him 
was her letter; and that she would get from him before furnishing
the money for the payment of his other debts.</p>
<p>These things out of the way, her thoughts turned to the matter
of the greater dread; that of which all along she had feared to 
think for a moment: Harold!</p>
<p>Harold! and her treatment of him!</p>
<p>The first reception of the idea was positive anguish.&nbsp; 
From the moment he had left her till now there had been no time 
when a consideration of the matter was possible.&nbsp; Time 
pressed, or circumstances had interfered, or her own personal 
condition had forbidden.&nbsp; Now, when she was alone, the whole
awful truth burst on her like an avalanche.&nbsp; Stephen felt 
the issue of her thinking before the thinking itself was 
accomplished; and it was with a smothered groan that she, in the 
darkness, held up her arms with fingers linked in desperate 
concentration of appeal.</p>
<p>Oh, if she could only take back one hour of her life, well she
knew what that hour would be!&nbsp; Even that shameful time with 
Leonard on the hill-top seemed innocuous beside the degrading 
remembrance of her conduct to the noble friend of her whole 
life.</p>
<p>Sadly she turned over in her bed, and with shut eyes put her 
burning face on the pillow, to hide, as it were, from herself her
abject depth of shame.</p>
<p>Leonard lounged through the next morning with what patience he
could.&nbsp; At four o&rsquo;clock he was at the door of 
Normanstand in his dogcart.&nbsp; This time he had a groom with 
him and a suitcase packed for a night&rsquo;s use, as he was to 
go on to London after his interview with Stephen.&nbsp; He had 
lost sight altogether of the matter of Stephen&rsquo;s letter, or
else he would have been more nervous.</p>
<p>He was taken into the blue drawing-room, where shortly Miss 
Rowly joined him.&nbsp; He had not expected this.&nbsp; His 
mental uneasiness manifested itself in his manner, and his 
fidgeting was not unobserved by the astute old lady.&nbsp; He was
disconcerted; &lsquo;overwhelmed&rsquo; would better have 
described his feelings when she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Norman is sorry she can&rsquo;t see you to-day as 
she is making a visit; but she has given me a message for you, or
rather a commission to discharge.&nbsp; Perhaps you had better 
sit down at the table; there are writing materials there, and I 
shall want a receipt of some sort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stephen did not say anything about a 
receipt!&rsquo;&nbsp; The other smiled sweetly as she said in a 
calm way:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But unfortunately Miss Norman is not here; and so I 
have to do the best I can.&nbsp; I really must have some proof 
that I have fulfilled my trust.&nbsp; You see, Mr. Everard, 
though it is what lawyers call a &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; 
transaction, it is more or less a business act; and I must 
protect myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leonard saw that he must comply, for time pressed.&nbsp; He 
sat down at the table.&nbsp; Taking up a pen and drawing a sheet 
of paper towards him, he said with what command of his voice he 
could:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What am I to write?&rsquo;&nbsp; The old lady took from
her basket a folded sheet of notepaper, and, putting on her 
reading-glasses, said as she smoothed it out:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it would be well to say something like 
this&mdash;&ldquo;I, Leonard Everard, of Brindehow, in the Parish
of Normanstand, in the County of Norcester, hereby acknowledge 
the receipt from Miss Laetitia Rowly of nine hundred pounds 
sterling lent to me in accordance with my request, the same being
to clear me of a pressing debt due by me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he had finished writing the receipt Miss Rowly looked it 
over, and handing it back to him, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now sign; and date!&rsquo;&nbsp; He did so with 
suppressed anger.</p>
<p>She folded the document carefully and put it in her 
pocket.&nbsp; Then taking from the little pouch which she wore at
her belt a roll of notes, she counted out on the table nine notes
of one hundred pounds each.&nbsp; As she put down the last she 
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Norman asked me to say that a hundred pounds is 
added to the sum you specified to her, as doubtless the usurers 
would, since you are actually behind the time promised for 
repayment, require something extra as a solatium or to avoid 
legal proceedings already undertaken.&nbsp; In fact that they 
would &ldquo;put more salt on your tail.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
expression, I regret to say, is not mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leonard folded up the notes, put them into his pocket-book, 
and walked away.&nbsp; He did not feel like adding verbal thanks 
to the document already signed.&nbsp; As he got near the door the
thought struck him; turning back he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I ask if Stephen said anything about getting the 
document?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; she said icily, &lsquo;did 
you speak of any one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Norman, I meant!&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss Rowly&rsquo;s 
answer to this came so smartly that it left an added sting.&nbsp;
Her arrow was fledged with two feathers so that it must shoot 
true: her distrust of him and his own impotence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh no!&nbsp; Miss Norman knows nothing of this.&nbsp; 
She simply asked me to give you the money.&nbsp; This is my own 
doing entirely.&nbsp; You see, I must exercise my judgment on my 
dear niece&rsquo;s behalf.&nbsp; Of course it may not be 
necessary to show her the receipt; but if it should ever be 
advisable it is always there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her with anger, not unmixed with admiration, as, 
bowing rather lower than necessary, he went out of the door, 
saying sotto voce, between his teeth:</p>
<p>&lsquo;When my turn comes out you go!&nbsp; Neck and 
crop!&nbsp; Quick!&nbsp; Normanstand isn&rsquo;t big enough to 
hold us both!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;MORE BUSINESS</h2>
<p>When Leonard tendered the eight hundred pounds in payment of 
his debt of five hundred, Mr. Cavendish at first refused to take 
it.&nbsp; But when Leonard calmly but firmly refused to pay a 
single penny beyond the obligations already incurred, including 
interest on the full sum for one day, he acquiesced.&nbsp; He 
knew the type of man fully; and knew also that in all probability
it would not be long before he would come to the Firm again on a 
borrowing errand.&nbsp; When such time should come, he would put 
an extra clause into his Memorandum of Agreement which would 
allow the Firm full power to make whatever extra charge they 
might choose in case of the slightest default in making 
payment.</p>
<p>Leonard&rsquo;s visits to town had not of late been many, and 
such as he had had were not accompanied with a plethora of 
cash.&nbsp; He now felt that he had earned a holiday; and it was 
not till the third morning that he returned to Brindehow.&nbsp; 
His father made no comment on his absence; his only allusion to 
the subject was:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Back all right!&nbsp; Any news in town?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
There was, however, an unwonted suavity in his manner which made 
Leonard a little anxious.&nbsp; He busied himself for the balance
of the morning in getting together all his unpaid accounts and 
making a schedule of them.&nbsp; The total at first amazed almost
as much as it frightened him.&nbsp; He feared what Stephen would 
say.&nbsp; She had already commented unfavourably on the one 
amount she had seen.&nbsp; When she was face to face with this 
she might refuse to pay altogether.&nbsp; It would therefore be 
wise to propitiate her.&nbsp; What could he do in this 
direction?&nbsp; His thoughts naturally turned to the missing 
letter.&nbsp; If he could get possession of it, it would either 
serve as a sop or a threat.&nbsp; In the one case she would be so
glad to have it back that she would not stick at a few pounds; in
the other it would &lsquo;bring her to her senses&rsquo; as he 
put in his own mind his intention of blackmail.</p>
<p>He was getting so tightened up in situation that as yet he 
could only do as he was told, and keep his temper as well as he 
could.</p>
<p>Altogether it was in a chastened mood that he made his 
appearance at Normanstand later in the afternoon.&nbsp; He was 
evidently expected, for he was shown into the study without a 
word.&nbsp; Here Miss Rowly and Stephen joined him.&nbsp; Both 
were very kind in manner.&nbsp; After the usual greetings and 
commonplaces Stephen said in a brisk, businesslike way:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you the papers with you?&rsquo;&nbsp; He took the 
bundle of accounts from his pocket and handed them to her.&nbsp; 
After his previous experience he would have suggested, had he 
dared, that he should see Stephen alone; but he feared the old 
lady.&nbsp; He therefore merely said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid you will find the amount very large.&nbsp; 
But I have put down everything!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he had; and more than everything.&nbsp; At the last an idea
struck him that as he was getting so much he might as well have a
little more.&nbsp; He therefore added several good-sized amounts 
which he called &lsquo;debts of honour.&rsquo;&nbsp; This would, 
he thought, appeal to the feminine mind.&nbsp; Stephen did not 
look at the papers at once.&nbsp; She stood up, holding them, and
said to Miss Rowly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, if you will talk to Mr. Everard I will go over 
these documents quietly by myself.&nbsp; When I have been through
them and understand them all I shall come back; and we will see 
what can be done.&rsquo;&nbsp; She moved gracefully out of the 
room, closing the door behind her.&nbsp; As is usual with women, 
she had more than one motive for her action in going away.&nbsp; 
In the first place, she wished to be alone whilst she went over 
the schedule of the debts.&nbsp; She feared she might get angry; 
and in the present state of her mind towards Leonard the 
expression of any feeling, even contempt, would not be 
wise.&nbsp; Her best protection from him would be a manifest 
kindly negation of any special interest.&nbsp; In the second 
place, she believed that he would have her letter with the other 
papers, and she did not wish her aunt to see it, lest she should 
recognise the writing.&nbsp; In her boudoir, with a beating 
heart, she untied the string and looked through the papers.</p>
<p>Her letter was not among them.</p>
<p>For a few seconds she stood stock still, thinking.&nbsp; Then,
with a sigh, she sat down and began to read the list of debts, 
turning to the originals now and again for details.&nbsp; As she 
went on, her wonder and disgust grew; and even a sense of fear 
came into her thoughts.&nbsp; A man who could be so wildly 
reckless and so selfishly unscrupulous was to be feared.&nbsp; 
She knew his father was a comparatively poor man, who could not 
possibly meet such a burden.&nbsp; If he were thus to his father,
what might he be to her if he got a chance.</p>
<p>The thought of what he might have been to her, had he taken 
the chance she had given him, never occurred to her.&nbsp; This 
possibility had already reached the historical stage in her 
mind.</p>
<p>She made a few pencil notes on the list; and went back to the 
study.&nbsp; Her mind was made up.</p>
<p>She was quite businesslike and calm, did not manifest the 
slightest disapproval, but seemed to simply accept everything as 
facts.&nbsp; She asked Leonard a few questions on subjects 
regarding which she had made notes, such as discounts.&nbsp; Then
she held the paper out to him and without any preliminary remark 
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you please put the names to these?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you mean?&rsquo; he asked, flushing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The names of the persons to whom these sums marked 
&ldquo;debt of honour&rdquo; are due.&rsquo;&nbsp; His reply came
quickly, and was a little aggressive; he thought this might be a 
good time to make a bluff:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not see that that is necessary.&nbsp; I can settle
them when I have the money.&rsquo;&nbsp; Slowly and without 
either pause or flurry Stephen replied, looking him straight in 
the eyes as she handed him the papers:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it is not necessary!&nbsp; Few things in the 
world really are!&nbsp; I only wanted to help you out of your 
troubles; but if you do not wish me to . . . !&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Leonard interrupted in alarm:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No! no!&nbsp; I only spoke of these items.&nbsp; You 
see, being &ldquo;debts of honour&rdquo; I ought not to give the 
names.&rsquo;&nbsp; Looking with a keen glance at her set face he
saw she was obdurate; and, recognising his defeat, said as calmly
as he could, for he felt raging:</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right!&nbsp; Give me the paper!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Bending over the table he wrote.&nbsp; When she took the paper, a
look half surprised, half indignant, passed over her face.&nbsp; 
Her watchful aunt saw it, and bending over looked also at the 
paper.&nbsp; Then she too smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Leonard had printed in the names!&nbsp; The feminine keenness 
of both women had made his intention manifest.&nbsp; He did not 
wish for the possibility of his handwriting being 
recognised.&nbsp; His punishment came quickly.&nbsp; With a 
dazzling smile Stephen said to him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Leonard, you have forgotten to put the 
addresses!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that necessary?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course it is!&nbsp; Why, you silly, how is the money
to be paid if there are no addresses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leonard felt like a rat in a trap; but he had no 
alternative.&nbsp; So irritated was he, and so anxious to hide 
his irritation that, forgetting his own caution, he wrote, not in
printing characters but in his own handwriting, addresses evolved
from his own imagination.&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s eyes twinkled as 
he handed her the paper: he had given himself away all round.</p>
<p>Leonard having done all that as yet had been required of him, 
felt that he might now ask a further favour, so he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is one of those bills which I have promised to 
pay by Monday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Promised?&rsquo; said Stephen with wide-opened 
eyes.&nbsp; She had no idea of sparing him, she remembered the 
printed names.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, Leonard, I thought you said you 
were unable to pay any of those debts?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again he had put himself in a false position.&nbsp; He could 
not say that it was to his father he had made the promise; for he
had already told Stephen that he had been afraid to tell him of 
his debts.&nbsp; In his desperation, for Miss Rowly&rsquo;s 
remorseless glasses were full on him, he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought I was justified in making the promise after 
what you said about the pleasure it would be to help me.&nbsp; 
You remember, that day on the hilltop?&rsquo;</p>
<p>If he had wished to disconcert her he was mistaken; she had 
already thought over and over again of every form of 
embarrassment her unhappy action might bring on her at his 
hands.&nbsp; She now said sweetly and calmly, so sweetly and so 
calmly that he, with knowledge of her secret, was alarmed:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that was not a promise to pay.&nbsp; If you will 
remember it was only an offer, which is a very different 
thing.&nbsp; You did not accept it then!&rsquo;&nbsp; She was 
herself somewhat desperate, or she would not have sailed so close
to the wind.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, but I accepted later!&rsquo; he said quickly, 
feeling in his satisfaction in an epigrammatic answer a certain 
measure of victory.&nbsp; He felt his mistake when she went on 
calmly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Offers like that are not repeated.&nbsp; They are but 
phantoms, after all.&nbsp; They come at their own choice, when 
they do come; and they stay but the measure of a breath or 
two.&nbsp; You cannot summon them!&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard fell into
the current of the metaphor and answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know that even that is impossible.&nbsp; 
There are spells which call, and recall, even 
phantoms!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen was anxious to find his 
purpose.</p>
<p>Leonard felt that he was getting on, that he was again 
acquiring the upper hand; so he pushed on the metaphor, more and 
more satisfied with himself:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it is wonderful how simple some spells, and these 
the most powerful, can be.&nbsp; A remembered phrase, the 
recollection of a pleasant meeting, the smell of a forgotten 
flower, or the sight of a forgotten letter; any or all of these 
can, through memory, bring back the past.&nbsp; And it is often 
in the past that the secret of the future lies!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Rowly felt that something was going on before her which 
she could not understand.&nbsp; Anything of this man&rsquo;s 
saying which she could not fathom must be at least dangerous; so 
she determined to spoil his purpose, whatever it might be.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me!&nbsp; That is charmingly poetic!&nbsp; Past 
and future; memory and the smell of flowers; meetings and 
letters!&nbsp; It is quite philosophy.&nbsp; Do explain it all, 
Mr. Everard!&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard was not prepared to go on under
the circumstances.&nbsp; His own mention of &lsquo;letter,&rsquo;
although he had deliberately used it with the intention of 
frightening Stephen, had frightened himself.&nbsp; It reminded 
him that he had not brought, had not got, the letter; and that as
yet he was not certain of getting the money.&nbsp; Stephen also 
had noted the word, and determined not to pass the matter 
by.&nbsp; She said gaily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a letter is a spell, I think you have a spell of 
mine, which is a spell of my own weaving.&nbsp; You were to show 
me the letter in which I asked you to come to see me.&nbsp; It 
was in that, I think you said, that I mentioned your debts; but I
don&rsquo;t remember doing so.&nbsp; Show it to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not got it with me!&rsquo;&nbsp; This was said 
with mulish sullenness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I forgot.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a pity!&nbsp; It is always a pity to forget 
things in a business transaction; as this is.&nbsp; I think, 
Auntie, we must wait till we have all the documents, before we 
can complete this transaction!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leonard was seriously alarmed.&nbsp; If the matter of the loan
were not gone on with at once the jeweller&rsquo;s bill could not
be paid by Monday, and the result would be another scene with his
father.&nbsp; He turned to Stephen and said as charmingly as he 
could, and he was all in earnest now:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m awfully sorry!&nbsp; But these debts have 
been so worrying me that they put lots of things out of my 
head.&nbsp; That bill to be paid on Monday, when I haven&rsquo;t 
a feather to fly with, is enough to drive a fellow off his 
chump.&nbsp; The moment I lay my hands on the letter I shall keep
it with me so that I can&rsquo;t forget it again.&nbsp; 
Won&rsquo;t you forgive me for this time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgive!&rsquo; she answered, with a laugh.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Why it&rsquo;s not worth forgiveness!&nbsp; It is not 
worth a second thought!&nbsp; All right!&nbsp; Leonard, make your
mind easy; the bill will be paid on Monday!&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss 
Rowly said quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have to be in London on Monday afternoon; I can pay 
it for you.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was a shock to Leonard; he said 
impulsively:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I say!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t I . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; His 
words faded away as the old lady again raised her lorgnon and 
gazed at him calmly.&nbsp; She went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know, my dear, it won&rsquo;t be even out of my 
way, as I have to call at Mr. Malpas&rsquo;s office, and I can go
there from the hotel in Regent Street.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was all 
news to Stephen.&nbsp; She did not know that her aunt had 
intended going to London; and indeed she did not know of any 
business with Mr. Malpas, whose firm had been London solicitor to
the Rowlys for several generations.&nbsp; She had no doubt, 
however, as to the old lady&rsquo;s intention.&nbsp; It was plain
to her that she wanted to help.&nbsp; So she thanked her 
sweetly.&nbsp; Leonard could say nothing.&nbsp; He seemed to be 
left completely out of it.&nbsp; When Stephen rose, as a hint to 
him that it was time for him to go, he said humbly, as he 
left:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would it be possible that I should have the receipt 
before Monday evening?&nbsp; I want to show it to my 
father.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly!&rsquo; said the old lady, answering 
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall be back by the two o&rsquo;clock train;
and if you happen to be at the railway station at Norcester when 
I arrive I can give it to you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went away relieved, but vindictive; determined in his own 
mind that when he had received the money for the rest of the 
debts he would see Stephen, when the old lady was not present, 
and have it out with her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;A LETTER</h2>
<p>On Monday evening after dinner Mr. Everard and his son sat for
a while in silence.&nbsp; They had not met since morning; and in 
the presence of the servants conversation had been scrupulously 
polite.&nbsp; Now, though they were both waiting to talk, neither
liked to begin.&nbsp; The older man was outwardly placid, when 
Leonard, a little flushed and a little nervous of voice, 
began:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you had any more bills?&rsquo;&nbsp; He had 
expected none, and thus hoped to begin by scoring against his 
father.&nbsp; It was something of a set-down when the latter, 
taking some papers from his breast-pocket, handed them to him, 
saying:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Only these!&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard took them in silence 
and looked at them.&nbsp; All were requests for payment of debts 
due by his son.</p>
<p>In each case the full bill was enclosed.&nbsp; He was silent a
while; but his father spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It would almost seem as if all these people had made up
their minds that you were of no further use to them.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then without pausing he said, but in a sharper voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you paid the jewellers?&nbsp; This is 
Monday!&rsquo;&nbsp; Without speaking Leonard took leisurely from
his pocket folded paper.&nbsp; This he opened, and, after 
deliberately smoothing out the folds, handed it to his 
father.&nbsp; Doubtless something in his manner had already 
convinced the latter that the debt was paid.&nbsp; He took the 
paper in as leisurely a way as it had been given, adjusted his 
spectacles, and read it.&nbsp; Seeing that his son had scored 
this time, he covered his chagrin with an appearance of paternal 
satisfaction.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo;&nbsp; For many reasons he was glad the 
debt was paid He was himself too poor a man to allow the constant
drain his son&rsquo;s debts, and too careful of his position to 
be willing have such exposure as would come with a County Court 
action against his son.&nbsp; All the same, his exasperation 
continued.&nbsp; Neither was his quiver yet empty.&nbsp; He shot 
his next arrow:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad you paid off those usurers!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Leonard did not like the definite way he spoke.&nbsp; Still in 
silence, he took from his pocket a second paper, which he handed 
over unfolded.&nbsp; Mr. Everard read it, and returned it 
politely, with again one word:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo;&nbsp; For a few minutes there was 
silence.&nbsp; The father spoke again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those other debts, have you paid them?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
With a calm deliberation so full of tacit rudeness that it made 
his father flush Leonard answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet, sir!&nbsp; But I shall think of them 
presently.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care to be bustled by them; and I 
don&rsquo;t mean to!&rsquo;&nbsp; It was apparent that though he 
spoke verbally of his creditors, his meaning was with regard to 
others also.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When will they be paid?&rsquo;&nbsp; As his son 
hesitated, he went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am alluding to those who have written to me.&nbsp; I 
take it that as my estate is not entailed, and as you have no 
income except from me, the credit which has been extended to you 
has been rather on my account than your own.&nbsp; Therefore, as 
the matter touches my own name, I am entitled to know something 
of what is going on.&rsquo;&nbsp; His manner as well as his words
was so threatening that Leonard was a little afraid.&nbsp; He 
might imperil his inheritance.&nbsp; He answered quickly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, sir, you shall know everything.&nbsp; After 
all, you know, my affairs are your affairs!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know nothing of the sort.&nbsp; I may of course be 
annoyed by your affairs, even dishonoured, in a way, by 
them.&nbsp; But I accept no responsibility whatever.&nbsp; As you
have made your bed, so must you lie on it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, sir, I assure you.&nbsp; All my 
debts, both those you know of and some you don&rsquo;t, I shall 
settle very shortly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How soon?&rsquo;&nbsp; The question was sternly 
put.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In a few days.&nbsp; I dare say a week at furthest will
see everything straightened out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The elder man stood, saying gravely as he went to the 
door:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will do well to tell me when the last of them is 
paid.&nbsp; There is something which I shall then want to tell 
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; Without waiting for reply he went to his 
study.</p>
<p>Leonard went to his room and made a systematic, though 
unavailing, search for Stephen&rsquo;s letter; thinking that by 
some chance he might have recovered it from Harold and had 
overlooked it.</p>
<p>The next few days he passed in considerable suspense.&nbsp; He
did not dare go near Normanstand until he was summoned, as he 
knew he would be when he was required.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When Miss Rowly returned from her visit to London she told 
Stephen that she had paid the bill at the jeweller&rsquo;s, and 
had taken the precaution of getting a receipt, together with a 
duplicate for Mr. Everard.&nbsp; The original was by her own 
request made out as received from Miss Laetitia Rowly in 
settlement of the account of Leonard Everard, Esq.; the duplicate
merely was &lsquo;recd. in settlement of the account 
of&mdash;,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s brows bent hit 
thought as she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why did you have it done that way, Auntie 
dear?&rsquo;&nbsp; The other answered quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had a reason, my dear; good reason!&nbsp; Perhaps I 
shall tell you all about it some day; in the meantime I want you 
not to ask me anything about it.&nbsp; I have a reason for that 
too.&nbsp; Stephen, won&rsquo;t you trust me in this, 
blindfold?&rsquo;&nbsp; There was something so sweet and loving 
in the way she made the request that Stephen was filled with 
emotion.&nbsp; She put her arms round her aunt&rsquo;s neck and 
hugged her tight.&nbsp; Then laying her head on her bosom she 
said with a sigh:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my dear, you can&rsquo;t know how I trust you; or 
how much your trust is to me.&nbsp; You never can 
know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next day the two women held a long consultation over the 
schedule of Leonard&rsquo;s debts.&nbsp; Neither said a word of 
disfavour, or even commented on the magnitude.&nbsp; The only 
remark touching on the subject was made by Miss Rowly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must ask for proper discounts.&nbsp; Oh, the 
villainy of those tradesmen!&nbsp; I do believe they charge 
double in the hope of getting half.&nbsp; As to jewellers . . . 
!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she announced her intention of going up to 
town again on Thursday, at which visit she would arrange for the 
payment of the various debts.&nbsp; Stephen tried to remonstrate,
but she was obdurate.&nbsp; She held Stephen&rsquo;s hand in hers
and stroked it lovingly as she kept on repeating:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leave it all to me, dear!&nbsp; Leave it all to 
me!&nbsp; Everything shall be paid as you wish; but leave it to 
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen acquiesced.&nbsp; This gentle yielding was new in her;
it touched the elder lady to the quick, even whilst it pained 
her.&nbsp; Well she knew that some trouble must have gone to the 
smoothing of that imperious nature.</p>
<p>Stephen&rsquo;s inner life in these last few days was so 
bitterly sad that she kept it apart from all the routine of 
social existence.&nbsp; Into it never came now, except as the 
exciting cause of all the evil, a thought of Leonard.&nbsp; The 
saddening memory was of Harold.&nbsp; And of him the sadness was 
increased and multiplied by a haunting fear.&nbsp; Since he had 
walked out of the grove she had not seen him nor heard from 
him.&nbsp; This was in itself strange; for in all her life, when 
she was at home and he too, never a day passed without her seeing
him.&nbsp; She had heard her aunt say that word had come of his 
having made a sudden journey to London, from which he had not yet
returned.&nbsp; She was afraid to make inquiries.&nbsp; Partly 
lest she might hear bad news&mdash;this was her secret fear; 
partly lest she might bring some attention to herself in 
connection with his going.&nbsp; Of some things in connection 
with her conduct to him she was afraid to think at all.&nbsp; 
Thought, she felt, would come in time, and with it new pains and 
new shames, of which as yet she dared not think.</p>
<p>One morning came an envelope directed in Harold&rsquo;s 
hand.&nbsp; The sight made her almost faint.&nbsp; She rejoiced 
that she had been first down, and had opened the postbag with her
own key.&nbsp; She took the letter to her room and shut herself 
in before opening it.&nbsp; Within were a few lines of writing 
and her own letter to Leonard in its envelope.&nbsp; Her head 
beat so hard that she could scarcely see; but gradually the 
writing seemed to grow out of the mist:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The enclosed should be in your hands.&nbsp; It is 
possible that it may comfort you to know that it is safe.&nbsp; 
Whatever may come, God love and guard you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For a moment joy, hot and strong, blazed through her.&nbsp; 
The last words were ringing through her brain.&nbsp; Then came 
the cold shock, and the gloom of fear.&nbsp; Harold would never 
have written thus unless he was going away!&nbsp; It was a 
farewell!</p>
<p>For a long time she stood, motionless, holding the letter in 
her hand.&nbsp; Then she said, half aloud:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Comfort!&nbsp; Comfort!&nbsp; There is no more comfort 
in the world for me!&nbsp; Never, never again!&nbsp; Oh, 
Harold!&nbsp; Harold!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sank on her knees beside her bed, and buried her face in 
her cold hands, sobbing in all that saddest and bitterest phase 
of sorrow which can be to a woman&rsquo;s heart: the sorrow that 
is dry-eyed and without hope.</p>
<p>Presently the habit of caution which had governed her last 
days woke her to action.&nbsp; She bathed her eyes, smoothed her 
hair, locked the letter and its enclosure in the little 
jewel-safe let into the wall, and came down to breakfast.</p>
<p>The sense of loss was so strong on her that she forgot 
herself.&nbsp; Habit carried her on without will or voluntary 
effort, and, so faithfully worked to her good that even the 
loving eyes of her aunt&mdash;and the eyes of love are 
keen&mdash;had no suspicion that any new event had come into her 
life.</p>
<p>Not till she was alone in her room that night did Stephen dare
to let her thoughts run freely.&nbsp; In the darkness her mind 
began to work truly, so truly that she began at the first step of
logical process: to study facts.&nbsp; And to study them she must
question till she found motive.</p>
<p>Why had Harold sent her the letter?&nbsp; His own words said 
that it should be in her hands.&nbsp; Then, again, he said it 
might comfort her to know the letter was safe.&nbsp; How could it
comfort her?&nbsp; How did he get possession of the letter?</p>
<p>There she began to understand; her quick intuition and her old
knowledge of Harold&rsquo;s character and her new knowledge of 
Leonard&rsquo;s, helped her to reconstruct causes.&nbsp; In his 
interview with her he had admitted that Leonard had told him 
much, all.&nbsp; He would no doubt have refused to believe him, 
and Leonard would have shown him, as proof, her letter asking him
to meet her.&nbsp; He would have seen then, as she did now, how 
much the possession of that letter might mean to any one.</p>
<p>Good God! to &lsquo;any one.&rsquo;&nbsp; Could it have been 
so to Harold himself . . . that he thought to use it as an 
engine, to force her to meet his wishes&mdash;as Leonard had 
already tried to do!&nbsp; The mistrust, founded on her fear, was
not dead yet . . . No! no! no!&nbsp; Her whole being resented 
such a monstrous proposition!&nbsp; Besides, there was 
proof.&nbsp; Thank God! there was proof.&nbsp; A blackmailer 
would have stayed close to her, and would have kept the letter; 
Harold did neither.&nbsp; Her recognition of the truth was shown 
in her act, when, stretching out her arms in the darkness, she 
whispered pleadingly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgive me, Harold!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And Harold, far away where the setting sun was lying red on 
the rim of the western sea, could not hear her.&nbsp; But perhaps
God did.</p>
<p>As, then, Harold&rsquo;s motive was not of the basest, it must
have been of the noblest.&nbsp; What would be a man&rsquo;s 
noblest motive under such circumstances?&nbsp; Surely 
self-sacrifice!</p>
<p>And yet there could be no doubt as to Harold&rsquo;s 
earnestness when he had told her that he loved her . . .</p>
<p>Here Stephen covered her face in one moment of rapture.&nbsp; 
But the gloom that followed was darker than the night.&nbsp; She 
did not pursue the thought.&nbsp; That would come later when she 
should understand.</p>
<p>And yet, so little do we poor mortals know the verities of 
things, so blind are we to things thrust before our eyes, that 
she understood more in that moment of ecstasy than in all the 
reasoning that preceded and followed it.&nbsp; But the reasoning 
went on:</p>
<p>If he really loved, and told her so, wherein was the 
self-sacrifice?&nbsp; She had reproached him with coming to her 
with his suit hotfoot upon his knowledge of her shameful proffer 
of herself to another man; of her refusal by him.&nbsp; Could he 
have been so blind as not to have seen, as she did, the shameful 
aspect of his impulsive act?&nbsp; Surely, if he had thought, he 
must have seen! . . . And he must have thought; there had been 
time for it.&nbsp; It was at dinner that he had seen Leonard; it 
was after breakfast when he had seen her . . . And if he had seen
then . . .</p>
<p>In an instant it all burst upon her; the whole splendid 
truth.&nbsp; He had held back the expression of his long love for
her, waiting for the time when her maturity might enable her to 
understand truly and judge wisely; waiting till her grief for the
loss of her father had become a story of the past; waiting for 
God knows what a man&rsquo;s mind sees of obstacles when he 
loves.&nbsp; But he had spoken it out when it was to her 
benefit.&nbsp; What, then, had been his idea of her 
benefit?&nbsp; Was it that he wished to meet the desire that she 
had manifested to have some man to&mdash;to love? . . . The way 
she covered her face with her hands whilst she groaned aloud made
her answer to her own query a perfect negative.</p>
<p>Was it, then, to save her from the evil of marrying Leonard in
case he should repent of his harshness, and later on yield 
himself to her wooing?&nbsp; The fierce movement of her whole 
body, which almost threw the clothes from her bed, as the 
shameful recollection rolled over her, marked the measure of her 
self-disdain.</p>
<p>One other alternative there was; but it seemed so remote, so 
far-fetched, so noble, so unlike what a woman would do, that she 
could only regard it in a shamefaced way.&nbsp; She put the 
matter to herself questioningly, and with a meekness which had 
its roots deeper than she knew.&nbsp; And here out of the depths 
of her humility came a noble thought.&nbsp; A noble thought, 
which was a noble truth.&nbsp; Through the darkness of the night,
through the inky gloom of her own soul came with that thought a 
ray of truth which, whilst it showed her her own shrivelled 
unworthiness, made the man whom she had dishonoured with insults 
worse than death stand out in noble relief.&nbsp; In that instant
she guessed at, and realised, Harold&rsquo;s unselfish nobility 
of purpose, the supreme effort of his constant love.&nbsp; 
Knowing the humiliation she must have suffered at Leonard&rsquo;s
hands, he had so placed himself that even her rejection of him 
might be some solace to her wounded spirit, her pride.</p>
<p>Here at last was truth!&nbsp; She knew it in the very marrow 
of her bones.</p>
<p>This time she did not move.&nbsp; She thought and thought of 
that noble gentleman who had used for her sake even that pent-up 
passion which, for her sake also, he had suppressed so long.</p>
<p>In that light, which restored in her eyes and justified so 
fully the man whom she had always trusted, her own shame and 
wrongdoing, and the perils which surrounded her, were for the 
time forgotten.</p>
<p>And its glory seemed to rest upon her whilst she slept.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX&mdash;CONFIDENCES</h2>
<p>Miss Rowly had received a bulky letter by the morning&rsquo;s 
post.&nbsp; She had not opened it, but had allowed it to rest 
beside her plate all breakfast-time.&nbsp; Then she had taken it 
away with her to her own sitting-room.&nbsp; Stephen did not 
appear to take any notice of it.&nbsp; She knew quite well that 
it was from some one in London whom her aunt had asked to pay 
Leonard&rsquo;s bills.&nbsp; She also knew that the old lady had 
some purpose in her reticence, so she waited.&nbsp; She was 
learning to be patient in these days.&nbsp; Miss Rowly did say 
anything about it that day, or the next, or the next.&nbsp; The 
third-morning, she received another letter which she had read in 
an enlightening manner.&nbsp; She began its perusal with set brow
frowning, then she nodded her head and smiled.&nbsp; She put the 
letter back in its envelope and placed it in the little bag 
always carried.&nbsp; But she said nothing.&nbsp; Stephen 
wondered, but waited.</p>
<p>That night, when Stephen&rsquo;s maid had left her, there came
a gentle tap at her door, and an instant after the door 
opened.&nbsp; The tap had been a warning, not a request; it had 
in a measure prepared Stephen, who was not surprised to see her 
Aunt in dressing-gown, though it was many a long day since she 
had visited her niece&rsquo;s room at night.&nbsp; She closed the
door behind her, saying:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is something I want to talk to you about, 
dearest, and I thought it would be better to do so when there 
could not be any possible interruption.&nbsp; And besides,&rsquo;
here there was a little break in her voice, &lsquo;I could hardly
summon up my courage in the daylight.&rsquo;&nbsp; She stopped, 
and the stopping told its own story.&nbsp; In an instant 
Stephen&rsquo;s arm&rsquo;s were round her, all the protective 
instinct in her awake, at the distress of the woman she 
loved.&nbsp; The old lady took comfort from the warmth of the 
embrace, and held her tight whilst she went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is about these bills, my dear.&nbsp; Come and sit 
down and put a candle near me.&nbsp; I want you to read 
something.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on, Auntie dear,&rsquo; she said gravely.&nbsp; The 
old lady, after a pause, spoke with a certain timidity:</p>
<p>&lsquo;They are all paid; at least all that can be.&nbsp; 
Perhaps I had better read you the letter I have had from my 
solicitors:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Dear Madam,&mdash;In accordance with your 
instructions we have paid all the accounts mentioned in Schedule 
A (enclosed).&nbsp; We have placed for your convenience three 
columns: (1) the original amount of each account, (2) the amount 
of discount we were able to arrange, and (3) the amount 
paid.&nbsp; We regret that we have been unable to carry out your 
wishes with regard to the items enumerated in Schedule B 
(enclosed).&nbsp; We have, we assure you, done all in our power 
to find the gentlemen whose names and addresses are therein 
given.&nbsp; These were marked &lsquo;Debt of honour&rsquo; in 
the list you handed to us.&nbsp; Not having been able to obtain 
any reply to our letters, we sent one of our clerks first to the 
addresses in London, and afterwards to Oxford.&nbsp; That clerk, 
who is well used to such inquiries, could not find trace of any 
of the gentlemen, or indeed of their existence.&nbsp; We have, 
therefore, come to the conclusion that, either there must be some
error with regard to (a) names, (b) addresses, or (c) both; or 
that no such persons exist.&nbsp; As it would be very unlikely 
that such errors could occur in all the cases, we can only 
conclude that there have not been any such persons.&nbsp; If we 
may hazard an opinion: it is possible that, these debts being 
what young men call &lsquo;debts of honour,&rsquo; the debtor, or
possibly the creditors, may not have wished the names 
mentioned.&nbsp; In such case fictitious names and addresses may 
have been substituted for the real ones.&nbsp; If you should like
any further inquiry instituted we would suggest that you 
ascertain the exact names and addresses from the debtor.&nbsp; Or
should you prefer it we would see the gentleman on your behalf, 
on learning from you his name and address.&nbsp; We can keep, in 
the person of either one of the Firm or a Confidential Clerk as 
you might prefer, any appointment in such behalf you may care to 
make.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We have already sent to you the receipted 
account from each of the creditors as you directed, viz. 
&lsquo;Received from Miss Laetitia Rowly in full settlement to 
date of the account due by Mr. Leonard Everard the sum of,&rsquo;
etc. etc.&nbsp; And also, as you further directed, a duplicate 
receipt of the sum-total due in each case made out as 
&lsquo;Received in full settlement to date of account due 
by,&rsquo; etc. etc.&nbsp; The duplicate receipt was pinned at 
the back of each account so as to be easily detachable.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;With regard to finance we have carried out your 
orders, etc.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; She hurried on the 
reading.&nbsp; &ldquo;These sums, together with the amounts of 
nine hundred pounds sterling, and seven hundred pounds sterling 
lodged to the account of Miss Stephen Norman in the Norcester 
branch of the Bank as repayment of moneys advanced to you as by 
your written instructions, have exhausted the sum, 
etc.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; She folded up the letter with the 
schedules, laying the bundle of accounts on the table.&nbsp; 
Stephen paused; she felt it necessary to collect herself before 
speaking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Auntie dear, will you let me see that letter?&nbsp; Oh,
my dear, dear Auntie, don&rsquo;t think I mistrust you that I ask
it.&nbsp; I do because I love you, and because I want to love you
more if it is possible to do so.&rsquo;&nbsp; Miss Rowly handed 
her the letter.&nbsp; She rose from the arm of the chair and 
stood beside the table as though to get better light from the 
candle than she could get from where she had sat.</p>
<p>She read slowly and carefully to the end; then folded up the 
letter and handed it to her aunt.&nbsp; She came back to her seat
on the edge of the chair, and putting her arms round her 
companion&rsquo;s neck looked her straight in the eyes.&nbsp; The
elder woman grew embarrassed under the scrutiny; she coloured up 
and smiled in a deprecatory way as she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that, darling; and 
don&rsquo;t shake your head so.&nbsp; It is all right!&nbsp; I 
told you I had my reasons, and you said you would trust me.&nbsp;
I have only done what I thought best!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Auntie, you have paid away more than half your 
little fortune.&nbsp; I know all the figures.&nbsp; Father and 
uncle told me everything.&nbsp; Why did you do it?&nbsp; Why did 
you do it?&rsquo;&nbsp; The old woman held out her arms as she 
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come here, dear one, and sit on my knee as you used to 
when you were a child, and I will whisper you.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Stephen sprang from her seat and almost threw herself into the 
loving arms.&nbsp; For a few seconds the two, clasped tight to 
each other&rsquo;s heart, rocked gently to and fro.&nbsp; The 
elder kissed the younger and was kissed impulsively in 
return.&nbsp; Then she stroked the beautiful bright hair with her
wrinkled hand, and said admiringly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What lovely hair you have, my dear one!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Stephen held her closer and waited.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my dear, I did it because I love you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know that, Auntie; you have never done anything else 
my life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is true, dear one.&nbsp; But it is right that I 
should do this.&nbsp; Now you must listen to me, and not speak 
till I have done.&nbsp; Keep your thoughts on my words, so that 
you may follow my thoughts.&nbsp; You can do your own thinking 
about them afterwards.&nbsp; And your own talking too; I shall 
listen as long as you like!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on, I&rsquo;ll be good!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, it is not right that you should appear to have
paid the debts of a young man who is no relation to you and who 
will, I know well, never be any closer to you than he is 
now.&rsquo;&nbsp; She hurried on, as though fearing an 
interruption, but Stephen felt that her clasp tightened.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;We never can tell what will happen as life goes on.&nbsp; 
And, as the world is full of scandal, one cannot be too careful 
not to give the scandalmongers anything to exercise their wicked 
spite upon.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t trust that young man! he is a bad
one all round, or I am very much mistaken.&nbsp; And, my dear, 
come close to me!&nbsp; I cannot but see that you and he have 
some secret which he is using to distress you!&rsquo;&nbsp; She 
paused, and her clasp grew closer still as Stephen&rsquo;s head 
sank on her breast.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know you have done something 
or said something foolish of which he has a knowledge.&nbsp; And 
I know my dear one, that whatever it was, and no matter how 
foolish it may have been, it was not a wrong thing.&nbsp; God 
knows, we are all apt to do wrong things as well as foolish ones;
the best of us.&nbsp; But such is not for you!&nbsp; Your race, 
your father and mother, your upbringing, yourself and the truth 
and purity which are yours would save you from anything which was
in itself wrong.&nbsp; That I know, my dear, as well as I know 
myself!&nbsp; Ah! better, far better! for the gods did not think 
it well to dower me as they have dowered you.&nbsp; The God of 
all the gods has given you the ten talents to guard; and He 
knows, as I do, that you will be faithful to your 
trust.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a solemn ring in her voce as the words were spoken 
which went through the young girl&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Love and 
confidence demanded in return that she should have at least the 
relief of certain acquiescence; there is a possible note of pain 
in the tensity of every string!&nbsp; Stephen lifted her head 
proudly and honestly, though her cheeks were scarlet, saying with
a consciousness of integrity which spoke directly soul to 
soul:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are right, dear!&nbsp; I have done something very 
foolish; very, very foolish!&nbsp; But it was nothing which any 
one could call wrong.&nbsp; Do not ask me what it was.&nbsp; I 
need only tell you this: that it was an outrage on 
convention.&nbsp; It was so foolish, and based on such foolish 
misconception; it sprang from such over-weening, arrogant 
self-opinion that it deserves the bitter punishment which will 
come; which is coming; which is with me now!&nbsp; It was the 
cause of something whose blackness I can&rsquo;t yet realise; but
of which I will tell you when I can speak of it.&nbsp; But it was
not wrong in itself, or in the eyes of God or man!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
The old woman said not a word.&nbsp; No word was needed, for had 
she not already expressed her belief?&nbsp; But Stephen felt her 
relief in the glad pressure of her finger-tips.&nbsp; In a voice 
less strained and tense Miss Rowly went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What need have I for money, dear?&nbsp; Here I have all
that any woman, especially at my age, can need.&nbsp; There is no
room even for charity; you are so good to all your people that my
help is hardly required.&nbsp; And, my dear one, I know&mdash;I 
know,&rsquo; she emphasised the word as she stroked the beautiful
hair, &lsquo;that when I am gone my own poor, the few that I have
looked after all my life, will, not suffer when my darling thinks
of me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen fairly climbed upon her as she said, 
looking in the brave old eyes:</p>
<p>&lsquo;So help me God, my darling, they shall never 
want!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Silence for a time; and then Miss Rowly&rsquo;s voice 
again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Though it would not do for the world to know that a 
young maiden lady had paid the debts of a vicious young man, it 
makes no matter if they be paid by an old woman, be the same 
maid, wife, or widow!&nbsp; And really, my dear, I do not see how
any money I might have could be better spent than in keeping harm
away from you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There need not be any harm at all, Auntie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Perhaps not, dear!&nbsp; I hope not with all my 
heart.&nbsp; But I fear that young man.&nbsp; Just fancy him 
threatening you, and in your own house; in my very 
presence!&nbsp; Oh! yes, my dear.&nbsp; He meant to threaten, 
anyhow!&nbsp; Though I could not exactly understand what he was 
driving at, I could see that he was driving at something.&nbsp; 
And after all that you were doing for him, and had done for 
him!&nbsp; I mean, of course, after all that I had done for him, 
and was doing for him.&nbsp; It is mean enough, surely, for a man
to beg, and from a woman; but to threaten afterwards.&nbsp; 
Ach!&nbsp; But I think, my dear, it is checkmate to him this 
time.&nbsp; All along the line the only proof that is of there 
being any friendliness towards him from this house points to 
me.&nbsp; And moreover, my dear, I have a little plan in my head 
that will tend to show him up even better, in case he may ever 
try to annoy us.&nbsp; Look at me when next he is here.&nbsp; I 
mean to do a little play-acting which will astonish him, I can 
tell you, if it doesn&rsquo;t frighten him out of the house 
altogether.&nbsp; But we won&rsquo;t talk of that yet.&nbsp; You 
will understand when you see it!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her eyes twinkled 
and her mouth shut with a loud snap as she spoke.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of repose, which was like a glimpse of 
heaven to Stephen&rsquo;s aching heart, she spoke again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was something else that troubled you more than 
even this.&nbsp; You said you would tell me when you were able to
speak of it . . . Why not speak now?&nbsp; Oh! my dear, our 
hearts are close together to-night; and in all your life, you 
will never have any one who will listen with greater sympathy 
than I will, or deal more tenderly with your fault, whatever it 
may have been.&nbsp; Tell me, dear!&nbsp; Dear!&rsquo; she 
whispered after a pause, during which she realised the depth of 
the girl&rsquo;s emotion by her convulsive struggling to keep 
herself in check.</p>
<p>All at once the tortured girl seemed to yield herself, and 
slipped inertly from her grasp till kneeling down she laid her 
head in the motherly lap and sobbed.&nbsp; Miss Rowly kept 
stroking her hair in silence.&nbsp; Presently the girl looked up,
and with a pang the aunt saw that her eyes were dry.&nbsp; In her
pain she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You sob like that, my child, and yet you are not 
crying; what is it, oh! my dear one?&nbsp; What is it that hurts 
you so that you cannot cry?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then the bitter sobbing broke out again, but still alas! 
without tears.&nbsp; Crouching low, and still enclosing her 
aunt&rsquo;s waist with her outstretched arms and hiding her head
in her breast; she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! Auntie, I have sent Harold away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, my dear?&nbsp; What?&rsquo; said the old lady 
astonished.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, I thought there was no one in the 
world that you trusted so much as Harold!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is true.&nbsp; There was&mdash;there is no one 
except you whom I trust so much.&nbsp; But I mistook something he
said.&nbsp; I was in a blind fury at the time, and I said things 
that I thought my father&rsquo;s daughter never could have 
said.&nbsp; And she never thought them, even then!&nbsp; Oh, 
Auntie, I drove him away with all the horrible things I could say
that would wound him.&nbsp; And all because he acted in a way 
that I see now was the most noble and knightly in which any man 
could act.&nbsp; He that my dear father had loved, and honoured, 
and trusted as another son.&nbsp; He that was a real son to him, 
and not a mock sop like me.&nbsp; I sent him away with such 
fierce and bitter pain that his poor face was ashen grey, and 
there was woe in his eyes that shall make woe in mine whenever I 
shall see them in my mind, waking or sleeping.&nbsp; He, the 
truest friend . . . the most faithful, the most tender, the most 
strong, the most unselfish!&nbsp; Oh! Auntie, Auntie, he just 
turned and bowed and went away.&nbsp; And he couldn&rsquo;t do 
anything else with the way I spoke to him; and now I shall never 
see him again!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The young girl&rsquo;s eyes ware still dry, but the old 
woman&rsquo;s were wet.&nbsp; For a few minutes she kept softly 
stroking the bowed heat till the sobbing grew less and less, and 
then died away; and the girl lay still, collapsed in the 
abandonment of dry-eyed grief.</p>
<p>Then she rose, and taking off her dressing-gown, said 
tenderly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me stay with you to-night, dear one?&nbsp; Go to 
sleep in my arms, as you did long ago when there was any grief 
that you could not bear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So Stephen lay in those loving arms till her own young breast 
ceased heaving, and she breathed softly.&nbsp; Till dawn she 
slept on the bosom of her who loved her so well.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI&mdash;THE DUTY OF COURTESY</h2>
<p>Leonard was getting tired of waiting when he received his 
summons to Normanstand.&nbsp; But despite his impatience he was 
ill pleased with the summons, which came in the shape of a polite
note from Miss Rowly asking him to come that afternoon at 
tea-time.&nbsp; He had expected to hear from Stephen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn that old woman!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d think she was 
working the whole show!&rsquo;&nbsp; However, he turned up at a 
little before five o&rsquo;clock, spruce and dapper and well 
dressed and groomed as usual.&nbsp; He was shown, as before, into
the blue drawing-room.&nbsp; Miss Rowly, who sat there, rose as 
he entered, and coming across the room, greeted him, as he 
thought, effusively.&nbsp; He actually winced when she called him
&lsquo;my dear boy&rsquo; before the butler.</p>
<p>She ordered tea to be served at once, and when it had been 
brought she said to the butler:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell Mannerly to bring me a large thick envelope which 
is on the table in my room.&nbsp; It is marked L.E. on the 
outside.&rsquo;&nbsp; Presently an elderly maid handed her the 
envelope and withdrew.&nbsp; When tea was over she opened the 
envelope, and taking from it a number of folios, looked over them
carefully; holding them in her lap, she said quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will find writing materials on the table.&nbsp; I 
am all ready now to hand you over the receipts.&rsquo;&nbsp; His 
eyes glistened.&nbsp; This was good news at all events; the debts
were paid.&nbsp; In a rapid flash of thought he came to the 
conclusion that if the debts were actually paid he need not be 
civil to the old lady.&nbsp; He felt that he could have been rude
to her if he had actual possession of the receipts.&nbsp; As it 
was, however, he could not yet afford to have any 
unpleasantness.&nbsp; There was still to come that lowering 
interview with his father; and he could not look towards it 
satisfactorily until he had the assurance of the actual documents
that he was safe.&nbsp; Miss Rowly was, in her own way, reading 
his mind in his face.&nbsp; Her lorgnon seemed to follow his 
every expression like a searchlight.&nbsp; He remembered his 
former interview with her, and how he had been bested in it; so 
he made up his mind to acquiesce in time.&nbsp; He went over to 
the table and sat down.&nbsp; Taking a pen he turned to Miss 
Rowly and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall I write?&rsquo;&nbsp; She answered 
calmly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Date it, and then say, &ldquo;Received from Miss 
Laetitia Rowly the receipts for the following amounts from the 
various firms hereunder enumerated.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; She then 
proceeded to read them, he writing and repeating as he 
wrote.&nbsp; Then she added:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;The same being the total amount of my debts 
which she has kindly paid for me.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused 
here; she asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought it was Stephen&mdash;Miss Norman,&rsquo; he 
corrected, catching sight of her lorgnon, &lsquo;who was paying 
them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good Lord, man,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;what does 
it matter who has paid them, so long as they are paid?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t ask you to pay them,&rsquo; he went 
on obstinately.&nbsp; There was a pause, and then the old lady, 
with a distinctly sarcastic smile, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seems to me, young man, that you are rather 
particular as to how things are done for you.&nbsp; If you had 
begun to be just a little bit as particular in making the debts 
as you are in the way of having them paid, there would be a 
little less trouble and expense all round.&nbsp; However, the 
debts have been paid, and we can&rsquo;t unpay them.&nbsp; But of
course you can repay me the money if you like.&nbsp; It amounts 
in all to four thousand three hundred and seventeen pounds, 
twelve shillings and sixpence, and I have paid every penny of it 
out of my own pocket.&nbsp; If you can&rsquo;t pay it yourself, 
perhaps your father would like to do so.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The last shot told; he went on writing: &lsquo;&ldquo;Kindly 
paid for me,&rdquo;&rsquo; she continued in the same even 
voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;In remembrance of my mother, of whom she was an 
acquaintance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now sign it!&rsquo;&nbsp; He did so 
and handed it to her.&nbsp; She read it over carefully, folded 
it, and put it in her pocket.&nbsp; She then stood.&nbsp; He rose
also; and as he moved to the door&mdash;he had not offered to 
shake hands with her&mdash;he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to see, Miss Norman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am afraid you will have to wait.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is over at Heply Regis.&nbsp; She went there for 
Lady Heply&rsquo;s ball, and will remain for a few days.&nbsp; 
Good afternoon!&rsquo;&nbsp; The tone in which the last two words
were spoken seemed in his ears like the crow of the victor after 
a cock-fight.</p>
<p>As he was going out of the room a thought struck her.&nbsp; 
She felt he deserved some punishment for his personal rudeness to
her.&nbsp; After all, she had paid half her fortune for him, 
though not on his account; and not only had he given no thanks, 
but had not even offered the usual courtesy of saying 
good-bye.&nbsp; She had intended to have been silent on the 
subject, and to have allowed him to discover it later.&nbsp; Now 
she said, as if it was an after-thought:</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the way, I did not pay those items you put down as 
&ldquo;debts of honour&rdquo;; you remember you gave the actual 
names and addresses.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; the question came from him 
involuntarily.&nbsp; The persecuting lorgnon rose again:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because they were all bogus!&nbsp; Addresses, names, 
debts, honour!&nbsp; Good afternoon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went out flaming; free from debt, money debts; all but 
one.&nbsp; And some other debts&mdash;not financial&mdash;whose 
magnitude was exemplified in the grinding of his teeth.</p>
<p>After breakfast next morning he said to his father:</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the way, you said you wished to speak to me, 
sir.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was something in the tone of his voice 
which called up antagonism.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you have paid your debts?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&nbsp; Now there is something which it is 
necessary I should call your attention to.&nbsp; Do you remember 
the day on which I handed you that pleasing epistle from Messrs. 
Cavendish and Cecil?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, sir.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you send a telegram to them?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You wrote it yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had a courteous letter from the money-lenders, 
thanking me for my exertions in securing the settlement of their 
claim, and saying that in accordance with the request in my 
telegram they had held over proceedings until the day 
named.&nbsp; I did not quite remember having sent any telegram to
them, or any letter either.&nbsp; So, being at a loss, I went to 
our excellent postmaster and requested that he would verify the 
sending of a telegram to London from me.&nbsp; He courteously 
looked up the file; which was ready for transference to the 
G.P.O., and showed me the form.&nbsp; It was in your 
handwriting.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused so long that Leonard 
presently said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was signed Jasper Everard.&nbsp; Jasper Everard! my 
name; and yet it was sent by my son, who was christened, if I 
remember rightly, Leonard!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he went on, only in 
a cold acrid manner which made his son feel as though a February 
wind was blowing on his back:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think there need not have been much trouble in 
learning to avoid confusing our names.&nbsp; They are really 
dissimilar.&nbsp; Have you any explanation to offer of 
the&mdash;the error, let us call it?&rsquo;&nbsp; A bright 
thought struck Leonard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, sir,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I put it in your name 
as they had written to you.&nbsp; I thought it only 
courteous.&rsquo;&nbsp; The elder man winced; he had not expected
the excuse.&nbsp; We went on speaking in the same calm way, but 
his tone was more acrid than before:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good! of course!&nbsp; It was only courteous of 
you!&nbsp; Quite so!&nbsp; But I think it will be well in the 
future to let me look after my own courtesy; as regards my 
signature at any rate.&nbsp; You see, my dear boy, a signature is
queer sort of thing, and judges and juries are apt to take a poor
view of courtesy as over against the conventions regarding a man,
writing his own name.&nbsp; What I want to tell you is this, that
on seeing that signature I made a new will.&nbsp; You see, my 
estate is not entailed, and therefore I think it only right to 
see that in such a final matter justice is done all round.&nbsp; 
I therefore made a certain provision of which I am sure you will 
approve.&nbsp; Indeed, since I am assured of the payment of your 
debts, I feel justified in my action.&nbsp; I may say, inter 
alia, that I congratulate you on either the extent of your 
resources or the excellence of your friendships, or both.&nbsp; I
confess that the amounts brought to my notice were rather large; 
more especially in proportion to the value of the estate which 
you are some day to inherit.&nbsp; For you are of course to 
inherit some day, my dear boy.&nbsp; You are my only son, and it 
would be hardly&mdash;hardly courteous of me not to leave it to 
you.&nbsp; But I have put a clause in my will to the effect that 
the trustee&rsquo;s are to pay all debts of your accruing which 
can be proved against you, before handing over to you either the 
estate itself or the remainder after its sale and the settlement 
of all claims.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; Now run away, my 
boy; I have some important work to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The day after her return from Heply Regis, Stephen was walking
in the wood when she thought she heard a slight rustling of 
leaves some way behind her.&nbsp; She looked round, expecting to 
see some one; but the leafy path was quite clear.&nbsp; Her 
suspicion was confirmed; some one was secretly following 
her.&nbsp; A short process of exclusions pointed to the 
personality of the some one.&nbsp; Tramps and poachers were 
unknown in Normanstand, and there was no one else whom she could 
think of who had any motive in following her in such a way; it 
must be Leonard Everard.&nbsp; She turned and walked rapidly in 
the opposite direction.&nbsp; As this would bring her to the 
house Leonard had to declare his presence at once or else lose 
the opportunity of a private interview which he sought.&nbsp; 
When she saw him she said at once and without any salutation:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What are you doing there; why are you following 
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted to see you alone.&nbsp; I could not get near 
you on account of that infernal old woman.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Stephen&rsquo;s face grew hard.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On account of whom?&rsquo; she asked with dangerous 
politeness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Rowly; your aunt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, Mr. Everard,&rsquo; she said 
icily, &lsquo;that it is at least an unpardonable rudeness to 
speak that way, and to me, of the woman I love best in all the 
world?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sorry!&rsquo; he said in the offhand way of younger 
days, &lsquo;I apologise.&nbsp; Fact is, I was angry that she 
wouldn&rsquo;t let me see you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not let you see me!&rsquo; she said as if amazed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I haven&rsquo;t been able to see you alone ever 
since I went to meet you on Caester Hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why should you see me alone?&rsquo; she asked as if
still in amazement.&nbsp; &lsquo;Surely you can say anything you 
have to say before my aunt.&rsquo;&nbsp; With an unwisdom for 
which an instant later he blamed himself he blurted out:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, old girl, you yourself did not think her presence 
necessary when you asked me to meet you on the hill.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When was that?&rsquo;&nbsp; She saw that he was angry 
and wanted to test him; to try how far he would venture.&nbsp; He
was getting dangerous; she must know the measure of what she had 
to fear.</p>
<p>He fell into the trap at once.&nbsp; His debts being paid, 
fear was removed, and all the hectoring side of the man was 
aroused.&nbsp; His antagonist was a woman; and he had already had
in his life so many unpleasant scenes with women that this was no
new experience.&nbsp; This woman had, by her own indiscretion, 
put a whip into his hand; and, if necessary to secure his own 
way, by God! he meant to use it!&nbsp; These last days had made 
her a more desirable possession in his eyes.&nbsp; The vastness 
of her estate had taken hold on him, and his father&rsquo;s 
remorseless intention with regard to his will would either keep 
him with very limited funds, or leave him eventually a pauper if 
he forestalled his inheritance.&nbsp; The desire of her wealth 
had grown daily, and it was now the main force in bringing him 
here to-day.&nbsp; And to this was now added the personal desire 
which her presence evoked.&nbsp; Stephen, at all times beautiful,
had never looked more lovely.&nbsp; In the days since she had met
him on the hilltop, a time that to her seemed so long ago, she 
had grown to be a woman, and there is some subtle inconceivable 
charm in completed womanhood.&nbsp; The reaction from her 
terrible fear and depression had come, and her strong brilliant 
youth was manifesting itself.&nbsp; Her step was springy and her 
eyes were bright; and the glow of fine health, accentuated by the
militant humour of the present moment, seemed to light up her 
beautiful skin.&nbsp; In herself she was desirable, very 
desirable; Leonard felt his pulses quicken and his blood leap as 
he looked at her.&nbsp; Even his prejudice against her red hair 
had changed to something like hungry admiration.&nbsp; Leonard 
felt for the first moment since he had known her that she was a 
woman; and that, with relation to her, he was a man.</p>
<p>And at the moment all the man in him asserted itself.&nbsp; It
was with half love, as he saw it, and half self-assertion that he
answered her question:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The day you asked me to marry you!&nbsp; Oh! what a 
fool I was not to leap at such a chance!&nbsp; I should have 
taken you in my arms then and kissed you till I showed you how 
much I loved you.&nbsp; But that will all come yet; the kissing 
is still to come!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Stephen, don&rsquo;t you see 
that I love you?&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you tell me that you love me 
still?&nbsp; Darling!&rsquo;&nbsp; He almost sprang at her, his 
arms extended to clasp her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her voice rang like a trumpet.&nbsp;
She did not mean to submit to physical violence, and in the 
present state of her feeling, an embrace from him would be a 
desecration.&nbsp; He was now odious to her; she positively 
loathed him.</p>
<p>Before her uplifted hand and those flashing eyes, he stopped 
as one stricken into stone.&nbsp; In that instant she knew she 
was safe; and with a woman&rsquo;s quickness of apprehension and 
resolve, made up her mind what course to pursue.&nbsp; In a calm 
voice she said quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Everard, you have followed me in secret, and 
without my permission.&nbsp; I cannot talk here with you, 
alone.&nbsp; I absolutely refuse to do so; now or at any other 
time.&nbsp; If you have anything especial to say to me you will 
find me at home at noon to-morrow.&nbsp; Remember, I do not ask 
you to come.&nbsp; I simply yield to the pressure of your 
importunity.&nbsp; And remember also that I do not authorise you 
in any way to resume this conversation.&nbsp; In fact, I forbid 
it.&nbsp; If you come to my house you must control yourself to my
wish!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then with a stately bow, whose imperious distance inflamed him
more than ever, and without once looking back she took her way 
home, all agitated inwardly and with fast beating heart.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII&mdash;FIXING THE BOUNDS</h2>
<p>Leonard came towards Normanstand next forenoon in considerable
mental disturbance.&nbsp; In the first place he was seriously in 
love with Stephen, and love is in itself a disturbing 
influence.</p>
<p>Leonard&rsquo;s love was all of the flesh; and as such had 
power at present to disturb him, as it would later have power to 
torture him.&nbsp; Again, he was disturbed by the fear of losing 
Stephen, or rather of not being able to gain her.&nbsp; At first,
ever since she had left him on the path from the hilltop till his
interview the next day, he had looked on her possession as an 
&lsquo;option,&rsquo; to the acceptance of which circumstances 
seemed to be compelling him.&nbsp; But ever since, that asset 
seemed to have been dwindling; and now he was almost beginning to
despair.&nbsp; He was altogether cold at heart, and yet highly 
strung with apprehension, as he was shown into the blue 
drawing-room.</p>
<p>Stephen came in alone, closing the door behind her.&nbsp; She 
shook hands with him, and sat down by a writing-table near the 
window, pointing to him to sit on an ottoman a little distance 
away.&nbsp; The moment he sat down he realised that he was at a 
disadvantage; he was not close to her, and he could not get 
closer without manifesting his intention of so doing.&nbsp; He 
wanted to be closer, both for the purpose of his suit and for his
own pleasure; the proximity of Stephen began to multiply his love
for her.&nbsp; He thought that to-day she looked better than 
ever, of a warm radiant beauty which touched his senses with 
unattainable desire.&nbsp; She could not but notice the passion 
in his eyes, and instinctively her eyes wandered to a silver gong
placed on the table well within reach.&nbsp; The more he glowed, 
the more icily calm she sat, till the silence between them began 
to grow oppressive.&nbsp; She waited, determined that he should 
be the first to speak.&nbsp; Recognising the helplessness of 
silence, he began huskily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came here to-day in the hope that you would listen to
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Her answer, given with a conventional smile, was
not helpful:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am listening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I did not accept 
your offer.&nbsp; If I had know when I was coming that day that 
you loved me . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; She interrupted him, calm of 
voice, and with uplifted hand:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never said so, did I?&nbsp; Surely I could not have 
said such a thing!&nbsp; I certainly don&rsquo;t remember 
it?&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard was puzzled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You certainly made me think so.&nbsp; You asked me to 
marry you, didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;&nbsp; Her answer came calmly,
though in a low voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then if you didn&rsquo;t love me, why did you ask me to
marry you?&rsquo;&nbsp; It was his nature to be more or less 
satisfied when he had put any one opposed to him proportionally 
in the wrong; and now his exultation at having put a poser 
manifested itself in his tone.&nbsp; This, however, braced up 
Stephen to cope with a difficult and painful situation.&nbsp; It 
was with a calm, seemingly genial frankness, that she answered, 
smilingly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know, that is what has been puzzling me from 
that moment to this!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her words appeared to almost 
stupefy Leonard.&nbsp; This view of the matter had not occurred 
to him, and now the puzzle of it made him angry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you mean to say,&rsquo; he asked hotly, &lsquo;that 
you asked a man to marry you when you didn&rsquo;t even love 
him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is exactly what I do mean!&nbsp; Why I did it is, 
I assure you, as much a puzzle to me as it is to you.&nbsp; I 
have come to the conclusion that it must have been from my 
vanity.&nbsp; I suppose I wanted to dominate somebody; and you 
were the weakest within range!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo;&nbsp; He was genuinely angry by this 
time, and, but for a wholesome fear of the consequences, would 
have used strong language.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see that I was the weakest 
about.&rsquo;&nbsp; Somehow this set her on her guard.&nbsp; She 
wanted to know more, so she asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harold An Wolf!&nbsp; You had him on a string 
already!&rsquo;&nbsp; The name came like a sword through her 
heart, but the bitter comment braced her to further 
caution.&nbsp; Her voice seemed to her to sound as though far 
away:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed!&nbsp; And may I ask you how you came to know 
that?&rsquo;&nbsp; Her voice seemed so cold and sneering to him 
that he lost his temper still further.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Simply because he told me so himself.&rsquo;&nbsp; It 
pleased him to do in ill turn to Harold.&nbsp; He did not forget 
that savage clutch at his throat; and he never would.&nbsp; 
Stephen&rsquo;s senses were all alert.&nbsp; She saw an 
opportunity of learning something, and went on with the same cold
voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I suppose it was that pleasing confidence which was
the cause of your refusal of my offer of marriage; of which 
circumstance you have so thoughtfully and so courteously reminded
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; This, somehow, seemed of good import to 
Leonard.&nbsp; If he could show her that his intention to marry 
her was antecedent to Harold&rsquo;s confidence, she might still 
go back to her old affection for him.&nbsp; He could not believe 
that it did not still exist; his experience of other women showed
him that their love outlived their anger, whether the same had 
been hot or cold.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It had nothing in the world to do with it.&nbsp; He 
never said a word about it till he threatened to kill 
me&mdash;the great brute!&rsquo;&nbsp; This was learning 
something indeed!&nbsp; She went on in the same voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And may I ask you what was the cause of such sanguinary
intention?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because he knew that I was going to marry 
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; As he spoke he felt that he had betrayed 
himself; he went on hastily, hoping that it might escape 
notice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because he knew that I loved you.&nbsp; Oh! Stephen, 
don&rsquo;t you know it now!&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see that I 
love you; and that I want you for my wife!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But did he threaten to kill you out of mere 
jealousy?&nbsp; Do you still go in fear of your life?&nbsp; Will 
it be necessary to arrest him?&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard was chagrined
at her ignoring of his love-suit, and in his self-engrossment 
answered sulkily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of him!&nbsp; And, besides, I 
believe he has bolted.&nbsp; I called at his house yesterday, and
his servant said they hadn&rsquo;t heard a word from 
him.&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s heart sank lower and 
lower.&nbsp; This was what she had dreaded.&nbsp; She said in as 
steady a voice as she could muster:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bolted!&nbsp; Has he gone altogether?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll come back all right, in time.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;s not going to give up the jolly good living he has 
here!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But why has he bolted?&nbsp; When he threatened to kill
you did he give any reason?&rsquo;&nbsp; There was too much talk 
about Harold.&nbsp; It made him angry; so he answered in an 
offhand way:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; And, moreover, I 
don&rsquo;t care!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; said Stephen, having ascertained what 
she wanted to know, &lsquo;what is it that you want to speak to 
me about?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her words fell on Leonard like a cold douche.&nbsp; Here had 
he been talking about his love for her, and yet she ignored the 
whole thing, and asked him what he wanted to talk about.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a queer girl you are.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t seem 
to attend to what a fellow is saying.&nbsp; Here have I been 
telling you that I love you, and asking you to marry me; and yet 
you don&rsquo;t seem to have even heard me!&rsquo;&nbsp; She 
answered at once, quite sweetly, and with a smile of superiority 
which maddened him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But that subject is barred!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you mean?&nbsp; Barred!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; I told you yesterday!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Stephen,&rsquo; he cried out quickly, all the 
alarm in him and all the earnestness of which he was capable 
uniting to his strengthening, &lsquo;can&rsquo;t you understand 
that I love you, with all my heart?&nbsp; You are so beautiful; 
so beautiful!&rsquo;&nbsp; He felt now in reality what he was 
saying.</p>
<p>The torrent of his words left no opening for her objection; it
swept all merely verbal obstacles before it.&nbsp; She listened, 
content in a measure.&nbsp; So long as he sat at the distance 
which she had arranged before his coming she did not fear any 
personal violence.&nbsp; Moreover, it was a satisfaction to her 
now to hear him, who had refused her, pleading in vain.&nbsp; The
more sincere his eloquence, the larger her satisfaction; she had 
no pity for him now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know I was a fool, Stephen!&nbsp; I had my chance 
that day on the hilltop; and if I had felt then as I feel now, as
I have felt every moment since, I would not have been so 
cold.&nbsp; I would have taken you in my arms and held you close 
and kissed you, again, and again, and again.&nbsp; Oh, 
darling!&nbsp; I love you!&nbsp; I love you!&nbsp; I love 
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; He held out his arms imploringly.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you love me?&nbsp; 
Won&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, paralysed with angry amazement.&nbsp; She was 
laughing.</p>
<p>He grew purple in the face; his hands were still 
outstretched.&nbsp; The few seconds seemed like hours.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Forgive me!&rsquo; she said in a polite tone, suddenly 
growing grave.&nbsp; &lsquo;But really you looked so funny, 
sitting there so quietly, and speaking in such a way, that I 
couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; You really must forgive me!&nbsp; 
But remember, I told you the subject was barred; and as, knowing 
that, you went on, you really have no one but yourself to 
blame!&rsquo;&nbsp; Leonard was furious, but managed to say as he
dropped his arms:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I love you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That may be, now,&rsquo; she went on icily.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;But it is too late.&nbsp; I do not love you; and I have 
never loved you!&nbsp; Of course, had you accepted my offer of 
marriage you should never have known that.&nbsp; No matter how 
great had been my shame and humiliation when I had come to a 
sense of what I had done, I should have honourably kept my part 
of the tacit compact entered into when I made that terrible 
mistake.&nbsp; I cannot tell you how rejoiced and thankful I am 
that you took my mistake in such a way.&nbsp; Of course, I do not
give you any credit for it; you thought only of yourself, and did
that which you liked best!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a nice sort of thing to tell a man!&rsquo; he 
interrupted with cynical frankness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I do not want to hurt you unnecessarily; but I wish
there to be no possible misconception in the matter.&nbsp; Now 
that I have discovered my error I am not likely to fall into it 
again; and that you may not have any error at all, I tell you now
again, that I have not loved you, do not love you, and never will
and never can love you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here an idea struck Leonard 
and he blurted out:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But do you not think that something is due to 
me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How do you mean?&rsquo;&nbsp; Her brows were puckered 
with real wonder this time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For false hopes raised in my mind.&nbsp; If I did not 
love you before, the very act of proposing to me has made me love
you; and now I love you so well that I cannot live without 
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; In his genuine agitation he was starting up, 
when the sight of her hand laid upon the gong arrested him.&nbsp;
She laughed as she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought that the privilege of changing one&rsquo;s 
mind was a female prerogative!&nbsp; Besides, I have done already
something to make reparation to you for the wrong of . . . 
of&mdash;I may put it fairly, as the suggestion is your 
own&mdash;of not having treated you as a woman!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Damn!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As you observe so gracefully, it is annoying to have 
one&rsquo;s own silly words come back at one, boomerang 
fashion.&nbsp; I made up my mind to do something for you; to pay 
off your debts.&rsquo;&nbsp; This so exasperated him that he said
out brutally:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No thanks to you for that!&nbsp; As I had to put up 
with the patronage and the lecturings, and the eyeglass of that 
infernal old woman, I don&rsquo;t intend . . . &rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen stood up, her hand upon the gong:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Everard, if you do not remember that you are in my 
drawing-room, and speaking of my dear and respected aunt, I shall
not detain you longer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He sat down at once, saying surlily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I forgot.&nbsp; You make me so
wild that&mdash;that . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; He chewed the ends of 
his moustache angrily.&nbsp; She resumed her seat, taking her 
hand from the gong.&nbsp; Without further pause she 
continued:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite right!&nbsp; It has been Miss Rowly who paid your
debts.&nbsp; At first I had promised myself the pleasure; but 
from something in your speech and manner she thought it better 
that such an act should not be done by a woman in my position to 
a man in yours.&nbsp; It might, if made public, have created 
quite a wrong impression in the minds of many of our 
friends.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was something like a snort from Leonard.&nbsp; She 
ignored it:</p>
<p>&lsquo;So she paid the money herself out of her own 
fortune.&nbsp; And, indeed, I must say that you do not seem to 
have treated her with much gratitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What did I say or do that put you off doing the thing 
yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall answer it frankly: It was because you 
manifested, several times, in a manner there was no mistaking, 
both by words and deeds, an intention of levying blackmail on me 
by using your knowledge of my ridiculous, unmaidenly act.&nbsp; 
No one can despise, or deplore, or condemn that act more than I 
do; so that rather than yield a single point to you, I am, if 
necessary, ready to face the odium which the public knowledge of 
it might produce.&nbsp; What I had intended to do for you in the 
way of compensation for false hopes raised to you by that act has
now been done.&nbsp; That it was done by my aunt on my behalf, 
and not by me, matters to you no more than it did to your 
creditors, who, when they received the money, made no complaint 
of injury to their feelings on that account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, when you think the whole matter over in quietness,
you will, knowing that I am ready at any time to face if 
necessary the unpleasant publicity, be able to estimate what 
damage you would do to yourself by any expos&eacute;.&nbsp; It 
seems to me that you would come out of it pretty badly all 
round.&nbsp; That, however, is not my affair; it entirely rests 
with yourself.&nbsp; I think I know how women would regard 
it.&nbsp; I dare say you best know how men would look at it; and 
at you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leonard knew already how the only man who knew of it had taken
it, and the knowledge did not reassure him!</p>
<p>&lsquo;You jade!&nbsp; You infernal, devilish, cruel, 
smooth-tongued jade!&rsquo;&nbsp; He stood as bespoke.&nbsp; She 
stood too, and stood watching him with her hand on the 
gong.&nbsp; After a pause of a couple of seconds she said 
gravely:</p>
<p>&lsquo;One other thing I should wish to say, and I mean 
it.&nbsp; Understand me clearly, that I mean it!&nbsp; You must 
not come again into my grounds without my special 
permission.&nbsp; I shall not allow my liberty to be taken away, 
or restricted, by you.&nbsp; If there be need at any time to come
to the house, come in ceremonious fashion, by the avenues which 
are used by others.&nbsp; You can always speak to me in public, 
or socially, in the most friendly manner; as I shall hope to be 
able to speak to you.&nbsp; But you must never transgress the 
ordinary rules of decorum.&nbsp; If you do, I shall have to take,
for my own protection, another course.&nbsp; I know you 
now!&nbsp; I am willing to blot out the past; but it must be the 
whole past that is wiped out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stood facing him; and as he looked at her clear-cut 
aquiline face, her steady eyes, her resolute mouth, her carriage,
masterly in its self-possessed poise, he saw that there was no 
further hope for him.&nbsp; There was no love and no fear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You devil!&rsquo; he hissed.</p>
<p>She struck the gong; her aunt entered the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, is that you, Auntie?&nbsp; Mr. Everard has finished
his business with me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then to the servant, who had 
entered after Miss Rowly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Everard would like his carriage.&nbsp; By the 
way,&rsquo; she added, turning to him in a friendly way as an 
afterthought, &lsquo;will you not stay, Mr. Everard, and take 
lunch with us?&nbsp; My aunt has been rather moping lately; I am 
sure your presence would cheer her up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, do stay, Mr. Everard!&rsquo; added Miss Rowly 
placidly.&nbsp; &lsquo;It would make a pleasant hour for us 
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Leonard, with a great effort, said with conventional 
politeness:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, awfully!&nbsp; But I promised my father to be 
home for lunch!&rsquo; and he withdrew to the door which the 
servant held open.</p>
<p>He went out filled with anger and despair, and, sad for him, 
with a fierce, overmastering desire&mdash;love he called 
it&mdash;for the clever, proud, imperious beauty who had so 
outmatched and crushed him.</p>
<p>That beautiful red head, which he had at first so despised, 
was henceforth to blaze in his dreams.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;THE MAN</h2>
<p>On the <i>Scoriac</i> Harold An Wolf, now John Robinson, kept 
aloof from every one.&nbsp; He did not make any acquaintances, 
did not try to.&nbsp; Some of those at table with him, being 
ladies and gentlemen, now and again made a polite remark; to 
which he answered with equal politeness.&nbsp; Being what he was 
he could not willingly offend any one; and there was nothing in 
his manner to repel any kindly overture to acquaintance.&nbsp; 
But this was the full length his acquaintanceship went; so he 
gradually felt himself practically alone.&nbsp; This was just 
what he wished; he sat all day silent and alone, or else walked 
up and down the great deck that ran from stem to stern, still 
always alone.&nbsp; As there were no second-class or steerage 
passengers on the <i>Scoriac</i>, there were no deck restraints, 
and so there was ample room for individual solitude.&nbsp; The 
travellers, however, were a sociable lot, and a general feeling 
of friendliness was abroad.&nbsp; The first four days of the 
journey were ideally fine, and life was a joy.&nbsp; The great 
ship, with bilge keels, was as steady as a rock.</p>
<p>Among the other passengers was an American family consisting 
of Andrew Stonehouse, the great ironmaster and contractor, with 
his wife and little daughter.</p>
<p>Stonehouse was a remarkable man in his way, a typical product 
of the Anglo-Saxon under American conditions.&nbsp; He had 
started in young manhood with nothing but a good education, due 
in chief to his own industry and his having taken advantage to 
the full of such opportunities as life had afforded to him.&nbsp;
By unremitting work he had at thirty achieved a great fortune, 
which had, however; been up to then entirely invested and 
involved in his businesses.&nbsp; With, however, the colossal 
plant at his disposal, and by aid of the fine character he had 
won for honesty and good work, he was able within the next ten 
years to pile up a fortune vast even in a nation where 
multi-millionaires are scattered freely.&nbsp; Then he had 
married, wisely and happily.&nbsp; But no child had come to crown
the happiness of the pair who so loved each other till a good 
many years had come and gone.&nbsp; Then, when the hope of issue 
had almost passed away, a little daughter came.&nbsp; Naturally 
the child was idolised by her parents, and thereafter every step 
taken by either was with an eye to her good.&nbsp; When the 
rigour of winter and the heat of summer told on the child in a 
way which the more hardy parents had never felt, she was whirled 
away to some place with more promising conditions of health and 
happiness.&nbsp; When the doctors hinted that an ocean voyage and
a winter in Italy would be good, those too were duly 
undertaken.&nbsp; And now, the child being in perfect health, the
family was returning before the weather should get too hot to 
spend the summer at their ch&acirc;let amongst the great pines on
the slopes of Mount Ranier.&nbsp; Like the others on board, Mr. 
and Mrs. Stonehouse had proffered travellers&rsquo; civilities to
the sad, lonely young man.&nbsp; As to the others, he had shown 
thanks for their gracious courtesy; but friendship, as in other 
cases, did not advance.&nbsp; The Stonehouses were not in any way
chagrined; their lives were too happy and too full for them to 
take needless offence.&nbsp; They respected the young man&rsquo;s
manifest desire for privacy; and there, so far as they were 
concerned, the matter rested.</p>
<p>But this did not suit the child.&nbsp; Pearl was a sweet 
little thing, a real blue-eyed, golden-haired little fairy, full 
of loving-kindness.&nbsp; All the mother-instinct in her, and 
even at six a woman-child can be a mother&mdash;theoretically, 
went out towards the huge, lonely, sad, silent young man.&nbsp; 
She insisted on friendship with him; insisted shamelessly, with 
the natural inclination of innocence which rises high above 
shame.&nbsp; Even the half-hearted protests of the mother, who 
loved to see the child happy, did not deter her; after the second
occasion of Pearl&rsquo;s seeking him, as she persisted, Harold 
could but remonstrate with the mother in turn; the ease of the 
gentle lady and the happiness of her child were more or less at 
stake.&nbsp; When Mrs. Stonehouse would say:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, darling!&nbsp; You must be careful not to annoy 
the gentleman,&rsquo; Pearl would turn a rosy all-commanding face
to her and answer:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, mother, I want him to play with me.&nbsp; You must
play with me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, as the mother would look at him,
he would say quickly, and with genuine heartiness too:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh please, madam, do let her play with me!&nbsp; Come, 
Pearl, shall you ride a cock-horse or go to market the way the 
gentleman rides?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the child would spring on his 
knee with a cry of delight, and their games began.</p>
<p>The presence of the child and her loving ways were unutterably
sweet to Harold; but his pleasure was always followed by a pain 
that rent him as he thought of that other little one, now so far 
away, and of those times that seemed so long since gone.</p>
<p>But the child never relaxed in her efforts to please; and in 
the long hours of the sea voyage the friendship between her and 
the man grew, and grew.&nbsp; He was the biggest and strongest 
and therefore most lovely thing on board the ship, and that 
sufficed her.&nbsp; As for him, the child manifestly loved and 
trusted him, and that was all-in-all to his weary, desolate 
heart.</p>
<p>The fifth day out the weather began to change; the waves grew 
more and more mountainous as the day wore on and the ship 
advanced west.&nbsp; Not even the great bulk and weight of the 
ship, which ordinarily drove through the seas without pitch or 
roll, were proof against waves so gigantic.&nbsp; Then the wind 
grew fiercer and fiercer, coming in roaring squalls from the 
south-west.&nbsp; Most of those on board were alarmed, for the 
great waves were dreadful to see, and the sound of the wind was a
trumpet-call to fear.</p>
<p>The sick stayed in their cabins; the rest found an interest if
not a pleasure on deck.&nbsp; Among the latter were the 
Stonehouses, who were old travellers.&nbsp; Even Pearl had 
already had more sea-voyages than fall to most people in their 
lives.&nbsp; As for Harold, the storm seemed to come quite 
naturally to him and he paced the deck like a ship-master.</p>
<p>It was fortunate for the passengers that most of them had at 
this period of the voyage got their sea legs; otherwise walking 
on the slippery deck, that seemed to heave as the rolling of the 
vessel threw its slopes up or down, would have been 
impossible.&nbsp; Pearl was, like most children, pretty 
sure-footed; holding fast to Harold&rsquo;s hand she managed to 
move about ceaselessly.&nbsp; She absolutely refused to go with 
any one else.&nbsp; When her mother said that she had better sit 
still she answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, mother, I am quite safe with The Man!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;The Man&rsquo; was the name she had given Harold, and by 
which she always now spoke of him.&nbsp; They had had a good many
turns together, and Harold had, with the captain&rsquo;s 
permission, taken her up on the bridge and showed her how to look
out over the &lsquo;dodger&rsquo; without the wind hurting her 
eyes.&nbsp; Then came the welcome beef-tea hour, and all who had 
come on deck were cheered and warmed with the hot soup.&nbsp; 
Pearl went below, and Harold, in the shelter of the charthouse, 
together with a good many others, looked out over the wild 
sea.</p>
<p>Harold, despite the wild turmoil of winds and seas around him,
which usually lifted his spirits, was sad, feeling lonely and 
wretched; he was suffering from the recoil of his little 
friend&rsquo;s charming presence.&nbsp; Pearl came on deck again 
looking for him.&nbsp; He did not see her, and the child, seeing 
an opening for a new game, avoided both her father and mother, 
who also stood in the shelter of the charthouse, and ran round 
behind it on the weather side, calling a loud &lsquo;Boo!&rsquo; 
to attract Harold&rsquo;s attention as she ran.</p>
<p>A few seconds later the <i>Scoriac</i> put her nose into a 
coming wave at just the angle which makes for the full exercise 
of the opposing forces.&nbsp; The great wave seemed to strike the
ship on the port quarter like a giant hammer; and for an instant 
she stood still, trembling.&nbsp; Then the top of the wave seemed
to leap up and deluge her.&nbsp; The wind took the flying water 
and threw it high in volumes of broken spray, which swept not 
only the deck but the rigging as high as the top of the 
funnels.&nbsp; The child saw the mass of water coming, and 
shrieking flew round the port side of the charthouse.&nbsp; But 
just as she turned down the open space between it and the funnel 
the vessel rolled to starboard.&nbsp; At the same moment came a 
puff of wind of greater violence than ever.&nbsp; The child, 
calling out, half in simulated half in real fear, flew down the 
slope.&nbsp; As she did so the gale took her, and in an instant 
whirled her, almost touching her mother, over the rail into the 
sea.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stonehouse shrieked and sprang forward as though to 
follow her child.&nbsp; She was held back by the strong arm of 
her husband.&nbsp; They both slipped on the sloping deck and fell
together into the scuppers.&nbsp; There was a chorus of screams 
from all the women present.&nbsp; Harold, with an instinctive 
understanding of the dangers yet to be encountered, seized a red 
tam-o&rsquo;-shanter from the head of a young girl who stood 
near.</p>
<p>Her exclamation of surprise was drowned in the fearful cry 
&lsquo;Man overboard!&rsquo; and all rushed down to the rail and 
saw Harold, as he emerged from the water, pull the red cap over 
his head and then swim desperately towards the child, whose 
golden hair was spread on the rising wave.</p>
<p>The instant after Pearl&rsquo;s being swept overboard might be
seen the splendid discipline of a well-ordered ship.&nbsp; Every 
man to his post, and every man with a knowledge of his 
duty.&nbsp; The First Officer called to the Quartermaster at the 
wheel in a voice which cut through the gale like a trumpet:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hard a port!&nbsp; Hard!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The stern of the great ship swung away to port in time to 
clear the floating child from the whirling screw, which would 
have cut her to pieces in an instant.&nbsp; Then the Officer 
after tearing the engine-room signal to &lsquo;Starboard engine 
full speed astern,&rsquo; ran for the lifebuoy hanging at the 
starboard end of the bridge.&nbsp; This he hurled far into the 
sea.&nbsp; As it fell the attached rope dragged with it the 
signal, which so soon as it reaches water bursts into smoke and 
flame&mdash;signal by day and night.&nbsp; This done, and it had 
all been done in a couple of seconds, he worked the electric 
switch of the syren, which screamed out quickly once, twice, 
thrice.&nbsp; This is the dread sound which means &lsquo;man 
overboard,&rsquo; and draws to his post every man on the ship, 
waking or sleeping.</p>
<p>The Captain was now on the bridge and in command, and the 
First Officer, freed from his duty there, ran to the emergency 
boat, swung out on its davits on the port side.</p>
<p>All this time, though only numbered by seconds, the 
<i>Scoriac</i> was turning hard to starboard, making a great 
figure of eight; for it is quicker to turn one of these great sea
monsters round than to stop her in mid career.&nbsp; The aim of 
her Captain in such cases is to bring her back to the weather 
side of the floating buoy before launching the boat.</p>
<p>On deck the anguish of the child&rsquo;s parents was 
pitiable.&nbsp; Close to the rail, with her husband&rsquo;s arms 
holding her tight to it, the distressed mother leaned out; but 
always moving so that she was at the nearest point of the ship to
her child.&nbsp; As the ship passed on it became more difficult 
to see the heads.&nbsp; In the greater distance they seemed to be
quite close together.&nbsp; All at once, just as a great wave 
which had hidden them in the farther trough passed on, the mother
screamed out:</p>
<p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s sinking! she&rsquo;s sinking!&nbsp; Oh, 
God!&nbsp; Oh, God!&rsquo; and she fell on her knees, her 
horrified eyes, set in a face of ashen grey, looking out between 
the rails.</p>
<p>But at the instant all eyes saw the man&rsquo;s figure rise in
the water as he began to dive.&nbsp; There was a hush which 
seemed deadly; the onlookers feared to draw breath.&nbsp; And 
then the mother&rsquo;s heart leaped and her cry rang out again 
as two heads rose together in the waste of sea:</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has her!&nbsp; He has her!&nbsp; He has her!&nbsp; 
Oh, thank God!&nbsp; Thank God!&rsquo; and for a single instant 
she hid her face in her hands.</p>
<p>Then when the fierce &lsquo;hurrah&rsquo; of all on board had 
been hushed in expectation, the comments broke forth.&nbsp; Most 
of the passengers had by this time got glasses of one kind or 
another.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s putting the cap on the 
child&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a cool one that.&nbsp; Fancy
him thinking of a red cap at such a time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay! we could see that cap, when it might be we 
couldn&rsquo;t see anything else.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; this from an old sailor standing by his 
boat, &lsquo;how he&rsquo;s raisin&rsquo; in the water.&nbsp; 
He&rsquo;s keeping his body between her an&rsquo; the spindrift 
till the squall has passed.&nbsp; That would choke them both in a
wind like this if he didn&rsquo;t know how to guard against 
it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s all right; he is!&nbsp; The little maid is 
safe wi&rsquo; him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, bless you!&nbsp; Bless you for those words,&rsquo; 
said the mother, turning towards him.&nbsp; &lsquo;At this moment
the Second Officer, who had run down from the bridge, touched Mr.
Stonehouse on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The captain asked me to tell you, sir, that you and 
Mrs. Stonehouse had better come to him on the bridge.&nbsp; 
You&rsquo;ll see better from there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They both hurried up, and the mother again peered out with 
fixed eyes.&nbsp; The Captain tried to comfort her; laying his 
strong hand on her shoulder, he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, there!&nbsp; Take comfort, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; 
She is in the hands of God!&nbsp; All that mortal man can do is 
being done.&nbsp; And she is safer with that gallant young giant 
than she could be with any other man on the ship.&nbsp; Look, how
he is protecting her!&nbsp; Why he knows that all that can be 
done is being done.&nbsp; He is waiting for us to get to him, and
is saving himself for it.&nbsp; Any other man who didn&rsquo;t 
know so much about swimming as he does would try to reach the 
lifebuoy; and would choke the two of them with the spindrift in 
the trying.&nbsp; Mind how he took the red cap to help us see 
them.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a fine lad that; a gallant lad!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;FROM THE DEEPS</h2>
<p>Presently the Captain handed Mrs. Stonehouse a pair of 
binoculars.&nbsp; For an instant she looked through them, then 
handed them back and continued gazing out to where the two heads 
appeared&mdash;when they did appear on the crest of the waves 
like pin-heads.&nbsp; The Captain said half to himself and half 
to the father:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother&rsquo;s eyes!&nbsp; Mother&rsquo;s eyes!&rsquo; 
and the father understood.</p>
<p>As the ship swept back to the rescue, her funnels sending out 
huge volumes of smoke which the gale beat down on the sea to 
leeward, the excitement grew tenser and tenser.&nbsp; Men dared 
hardly breathe; women wept and clasped their hands convulsively 
as they prayed.&nbsp; In the emergency boat the men sat like 
statues, their oars upright, ready for instant use.&nbsp; The 
officer stood with the falls in his hand ready to lower away.</p>
<p>When opposite the lifebuoy, and about a furlong from Harold 
and Pearl, the Captain gave the signal &lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; and 
then a second later: &lsquo;Full speed astern.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ready, men!&nbsp; Steady!&rsquo;&nbsp; As the coming 
wave slipping under the ship began to rise up her side, the 
officer freed the falls and the boat sank softly into the lifting
sea.</p>
<p>Instantly the oars struck the water, and as the men bent to 
them a cheer rang out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Harold and Pearl heard, and the man turning his head for a 
moment saw that the ship was close at hand, gradually drifting 
down to the weather side of them.&nbsp; He raised the child in 
his arms, saying:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Pearl, wave your hand to mother and say, 
hurrah!&rsquo;&nbsp; The child, fired into fresh hope, waved her 
tiny hand and cried &lsquo;Hurrah!&nbsp; Hurrah!&rsquo;&nbsp; The
sound could not reach the mother&rsquo;s ears; but she saw, and 
her heart leaped.&nbsp; She too waved her hand, but she uttered 
no sound.&nbsp; The sweet high voice of the child crept over the 
water to the ears of the men in the boat, and seemed to fire 
their arms with renewed strength.</p>
<p>A few more strokes brought them close, Harold with a last 
effort raised the child in his arms as the boat drove down on 
them.&nbsp; The boatswain leaning over the bow grabbed the child,
and with one sweep of his strong arm took her into the 
boat.&nbsp; The bow oarsman caught Harold by the wrist.&nbsp; The
way of the boat took him for a moment under water; but the next 
man; pulling his oar across the boat, stooped over and caught him
by the collar, and clung fast.&nbsp; A few seconds more and he 
was hauled abroad.&nbsp; A wild cheer from all on the 
<i>Scoriac</i> came, sweeping down on the wind.</p>
<p>When once the boat&rsquo;s head had been turned towards the 
ship, and the oars had bent again to their work, they came soon 
within shelter.&nbsp; When they had got close enough ropes were 
thrown out, caught and made fast; and then came down one of the 
bowlines which the seamen held ready along the rail of the lower 
deck.&nbsp; This was seized by the boatswain, who placed it round
him under his armpits.&nbsp; Then, standing with the child in his
arms he made ready to be pulled up.&nbsp; Pearl held out her arms
to Harold, crying in fear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, let The Man take me!&nbsp; I want to go with 
The Man!&rsquo;&nbsp; He said quietly so as not to frighten 
her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, dear!&nbsp; Go with him!&nbsp; He can do this 
better than I can!&rsquo;&nbsp; So she clung quietly to the 
seaman, holding her face pressed close against his 
shoulder.&nbsp; As the men above pulled at the rope, keeping it 
as far as possible from the side of the vessel, the boatswain 
fended himself off with his feet.&nbsp; In a few seconds he was 
seized by eager hands and pulled over the rail, tenderly holding 
and guarding the child all the while.&nbsp; In an instant she was
in the arms of her mother, who had thrown herself upon her knees 
and pressed her close to her loving heart.&nbsp; The child put 
her little arms around her neck and clung to her.&nbsp; Then 
looking up and seeing the grey pallor of her face, which even her
great joy could not in a moment efface, she stroked it and 
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Poor mother!&nbsp; Poor mother!&nbsp; And now I have 
made you all wet!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, feeling her father&rsquo;s 
hand on her head she turned and leaped into his arms, where he 
held her close.</p>
<p>Harold was the next to ascend.&nbsp; He came amid a regular 
tempest of cheers, the seamen joining with the passengers.&nbsp; 
The officers, led by the Captain waving his cap from the bridge, 
joined in the paean.</p>
<p>The boat was cast loose.&nbsp; An instant after the engine 
bells tinkled: &lsquo;Full speed ahead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stonehouse had no eyes but for her child, except for one 
other.&nbsp; When Harold leaped down from the rail she rushed at 
him, all those around instinctively making way for her.&nbsp; She
flung her arms around him and kissed him, and then before he 
could stop her sank to her knees at his feet, and taking his hand
kissed it.&nbsp; Harold was embarrassed beyond all 
thinking.&nbsp; He tried to take away his hand, but she clung 
tight to it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no!&rsquo; she cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;You saved my 
child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold was a gentleman and a kindly one.&nbsp; He said no word
till she had risen, still holding his hand, when he said 
quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There! there!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t cry.&nbsp; I was only 
too happy to be of service.&nbsp; Any other man on board would 
have done the same.&nbsp; I was the nearest, and therefore had to
be first.&nbsp; That was all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Stonehouse came to him and said as he grasped 
Harold&rsquo;s hand so hard that his fingers ached:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot thank you as I would.&nbsp; But you are a man 
and will understand.&nbsp; God be good to you as you have been 
good to my child; and to her mother and myself!&rsquo;&nbsp; As 
he turned away Pearl, who had now been holding close to her 
mother&rsquo;s hand, sprang to him holding up her arms.&nbsp; He 
raised her up and kissed her.&nbsp; Then he placed her back in 
her mother&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>All at once she broke down as the recollection of danger swept
back upon her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, Mother!&nbsp; Mother!&rsquo; she 
cried, with a long, low wail, which touched every one of her 
hearers to the heart&rsquo;s core.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The hot blankets are all ready.&nbsp; Come, there is 
not a moment to be lost.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be with you when I have
seen the men attended to!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the mother, holding her in her arms and steadied by two 
seamen lest she should slip on the wet and slippery deck, took 
the child below.</p>
<p>Harold was taken by another set of men, who rubbed him down 
till he glowed, and poured hot brandy and water into him till he 
had to almost use force against the superabundance of their 
friendly ministrations.</p>
<p>For the remainder of that day a sort of solemn gladness ruled 
on the <i>Scoriac</i>.&nbsp; The Stonehouse family remained in 
their suite, content in glad thankfulness to be with Pearl, who 
lay well covered up on the sofa sleeping off the effects of the 
excitement and the immersion, and the result of the potation 
which the Doctor had forced upon her.&nbsp; Harold was simply 
shy, and objecting to the publicity which he felt to be his fate,
remained in his cabin till the trumpet had blown the dinner 
call.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV&mdash;A LITTLE CHILD SHALL LEAD</h2>
<p>After dinner Harold went back to his cabin; locking himself 
in, he lay down on the sofa.&nbsp; The gloom of his great sorrow 
was heavy on him; the reaction from the excitement of the morning
had come.</p>
<p>He was recalled to himself by a gentle tapping.&nbsp; 
Unlocking and opening the door he saw Mr. Stonehouse, who said 
with trouble in his voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I came to you on account of my little 
child.&rsquo;&nbsp; There he stopped with a break in his 
voice.&nbsp; Harold, with intent to set his mind at ease and to 
stave off further expressions of gratitude, replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, pray don&rsquo;t say anything.&nbsp; I am only too 
glad that I was privileged to be of service.&nbsp; I only trust 
that the dear little girl is no worse for her&mdash;her 
adventure!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is why I am here,&rsquo; said the father 
quickly.&nbsp; &lsquo;My wife and I are loth to trouble 
you.&nbsp; But the poor little thing has worked herself into a 
paroxysm of fright and is calling for you.&nbsp; We have tried in
vain to comfort or reassure her.&nbsp; She will not be satisfied 
without you.&nbsp; She keeps calling on &ldquo;The Man&rdquo; to 
come and help her.&nbsp; I am loth to put you to further strain 
after all you have gone through to-day; but if you would 
come&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold was already in the passage as he 
spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I&rsquo;m coming.&nbsp; If I can in any way 
help it is both a pleasure and a duty to be with 
her.&rsquo;&nbsp; Turning to the father he added:</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is indeed a very sweet and good child.&nbsp; I 
shall never forget how she bore herself whilst we waited for aid 
to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must tell her mother and me all about it,&rsquo; 
said the father; much moved.</p>
<p>When they came close to the Stonehouses&rsquo; suite of rooms 
they heard Pearl&rsquo;s voice rising with a pitiful note of 
fear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is The Man?&nbsp; Oh! where is The Man?&nbsp; Why
doesn&rsquo;t he come to me?&nbsp; He can save me!&nbsp; I want 
to be with The Man!&rsquo;&nbsp; When the door opened and she saw
him she gave shriek of delight, and springing from the arms of 
her mother fairly leaped into Harold&rsquo;s arms which were 
outstretched to receive her.&nbsp; She clung to him and kissed 
him again and again, rubbing her little hands all over his face 
as though to prove to herself that he was real and not a 
dream.&nbsp; Then with a sigh she laid her head on his breast, 
the reaction of sleep coming all at once to her.&nbsp; With a 
gesture of silence Harold sat down, holding the child in his 
arms.&nbsp; Her mother laid a thick shawl over and sat down close
to Harold.&nbsp; Mr. Stonehouse stood quiet in the doorway with 
the child&rsquo;s nurse peering anxiously over his shoulder.</p>
<p>After a little while, when he thought she was asleep, Harold 
rose and began to place her gently in the bunk.&nbsp; But the 
moment he did so she waked with a scream.&nbsp; The fright in her
eyes was terrible.&nbsp; She clung to him, moaning and crying out
between her sobs:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t leave me!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t leave me!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t leave me!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold was much moved and held
the little thing tight in his strong arms, saying to her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No darling!&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t leave you!&nbsp; Look 
in my eyes, dear, and I will promise you, and then you will be 
happy.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked quickly up in his face.&nbsp; Then she kissed him 
lovingly, and rested her head, but not sleepily this time, on his
breast said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not afraid now!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 
going to stay with The Man!&rsquo;&nbsp; Presently Mrs. 
Stonehouse, who had been thinking of ways and means, and of the 
comfort of the strange man who had been so good to her child, 
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will sleep with mother to-night, darling.&nbsp; Mr.
. . . The Man,&rsquo; she said this with an appealing look of 
apology to Harold, &lsquo;The Man will stay by you till you are 
asleep . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; But she interrupted, not fretfully or 
argumentatively, but with a settled air of content:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to sleep with The 
Man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, dear one,&rsquo; the mother expostulated, 
&lsquo;The Man will want sleep too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, mother.&nbsp; He can sleep too.&nbsp; 
I&rsquo;ll be very good and lie quite quiet; but oh! mother, I 
can&rsquo;t sleep unless his arms are round me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m 
afraid if they&rsquo;re not the sea will get me!&rsquo; and she 
clung closer to Harold, tightening her arms round his neck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will not mind?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Stonehouse timidly
to Harold; and, seeing acquiescence in his face, added in a burst
of tearful gratitude:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! you are good to her to us all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; Harold said quietly.&nbsp; Then he said to
Pearl, in a cheerful matter-of-fact way which carried conviction 
to the child&rsquo;s mind:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, darling, it is time for all good little girls to 
be asleep, especially when they have had an&mdash;an interesting 
day.&nbsp; You wait here till I put my pyjamas on, and then 
I&rsquo;ll come back for you.&nbsp; And mother and father shall 
come and see you nicely tucked in!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be long!&rsquo; the child anxiously called 
after him as he hurried away.&nbsp; Even trust can have its 
doubts.</p>
<p>In a few minutes Harold was back, in pyjamas and slipper and a
dressing-gown.&nbsp; Pearl, already wrapped in a warm shawl by 
her mother, held out her arms to Harold, who lifted her.</p>
<p>The Stonehouses&rsquo; suite of rooms was close to the top of 
the companion-way, and as Harold&rsquo;s stateroom was on the 
saloon deck, the little procession had, much to the man&rsquo;s 
concern, run the gauntlet of the thong of passengers whom the bad
weather had kept indoors.&nbsp; When he came out of the day cabin
carrying the child there was a rush of all the women to make much
of the little girl.&nbsp; They were all very kind and no 
troublesome; their interest was natural enough, and Harold 
stopped whilst they petted the little thing.</p>
<p>The little procession followed.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Stonehouse 
coming next, and last the nurse, who manifested a phase of the 
anxiety of a hen who sees her foster ducklings waddling toward a 
pond.</p>
<p>When Harold was in his bunk the little maid was brought 
in.</p>
<p>When they had all gone and the cabin was dark, save for the 
gleam from the nightlight which the careful mother had placed out
of sight in the basin at the foot of the bunk, Harold lay a long 
time in a negative state, if such be possible, in so far as 
thought was concerned.</p>
<p>Presently he became conscious of a movement of the child his 
arms; a shuddering movement, and a sort of smothered groan.&nbsp;
The little thing was living over again in sleep the perils and 
fears of the day.&nbsp; Instinctively she put up her hands and 
felt the a round her.&nbsp; Then with a sigh clasped her arms 
round his neck, and with a peaceful look laid her head upon his 
breast.&nbsp; Even through the gates of sleep her instinct had 
recognised and realised protection.</p>
<p>And then this trust of a little child brought back the man to 
his nobler self.&nbsp; Once again came back to him that love 
which he had had, and which he knew now that he had never lost, 
for the little child that he had seen grow into full womanhood; 
whose image must dwell in his heart of hearts for evermore.</p>
<p>The long night&rsquo;s sleep quite restored Pearl.&nbsp; She 
woke fairly early and without any recurrence of fear.&nbsp; At 
first she lay still, fearing she would wake The Man, but finding 
that he was awake&mdash;he had not slept a wink all 
night&mdash;she kissed him and then scrambled out of bed.</p>
<p>It was still early morning, but early hours rule on 
shipland.&nbsp; Harold rang for the steward, and when the man 
came he told him to tell Mr. Stonehouse that the child was 
awake.&nbsp; His delight when he found the child unfrightened 
looking out of the port was unbounded.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;A NOBLE OFFER</h2>
<p>That day Harold passed in unutterable gloom.&nbsp; The 
reaction was strong on him; and all his woe, his bitter 
remembrance of the past and his desolation for the future, were 
with him unceasingly.</p>
<p>In the dusk of the evening he wandered out to his favourite 
spot, the cable-tank on top of the aft wheelhouse.&nbsp; Here he 
had been all alone, and his loneliness had the added advantage 
that from the isolated elevation he could see if anyone 
approached.&nbsp; He had been out there during the day, and the 
Captain, who had noticed his habit had had rigged up a canvas 
dodger on the rail on the weather side.&nbsp; When he sat down on
the coiled hawsers in the tank he was both secluded and 
sheltered.&nbsp; In this peaceful corner his thoughts ran freely 
and in sympathy with the turmoil of wind and wave.</p>
<p>How unfair it all was!&nbsp; Why had he been singled out for 
such misery?&nbsp; What gleam of hope or comfort was left to his 
miserable life since he had heard the words of Stephen; those 
dreadful words which had shattered in an instant all the 
cherished hopes of his life.&nbsp; Too well he remembered the 
tone and look of scorn with which the horrible truths had been 
conveyed to him.&nbsp; In his inmost soul he accepted them as 
truths; Stephen&rsquo;s soul had framed them and Stephen&rsquo;s 
lips had sent them forth.</p>
<p>From his position behind the screen he did not see the 
approaching figure of Mr. Stonehouse, and was astonished when he 
saw his head rise above the edge of the tank as he climbed the 
straight Jacob&rsquo;s ladder behind the wheelhouse.&nbsp; The 
elder man paused as he saw him and said in an apologetic way:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you forgive my intruding on your privacy?&nbsp; I 
wanted to speak to you alone; and as I saw you come here a while 
ago I thought it would be a good opportunity.&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold
was rising as he spoke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By all means.&nbsp; This place is common 
property.&nbsp; But all the same I am honoured in your seeking 
me.&rsquo;&nbsp; The poor fellow wished to be genial; but despite
his efforts there was a strange formality in the expression of 
his words.&nbsp; The elder man understood, and said as he hurried
forward and sank beside him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t stir!&nbsp; Why, what a cosy corner 
this is.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe at this moment there is such
peace in the ship!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once again the bitterness of Harold&rsquo;s heart broke out in
sudden words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope not!&nbsp; There is no soul on board to whom I 
could wish such evil!&rsquo;&nbsp; The old man said as he laid 
his hand softly on the other&rsquo;s shoulder:</p>
<p>&lsquo;God help you, my poor boy, if such pain is in your 
heart!&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Stonehouse looked out at the sea, at last
turning his face to him again he spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you feel that I intrude on you I earnestly ask you 
to forgive me; but I think that the years between your age and 
mine as well as my feeling towards the great obligation which I 
owe you will plead for excuse.&nbsp; There is something I would 
like to say to you, sir; but I suppose I must not without your 
permission.&nbsp; May I have it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you wish, sir.&nbsp; I can at least hear 
it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man bowed and went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I could not but notice that you have some great grief 
bearing upon you; and from one thing or another&mdash;I can tell 
you the data if you wish me to do so&mdash;I have come to the 
conclusion that you are leaving your native land because of 
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here Harold, wakened to amazement by the 
readiness with which his secret had been divined, said quickly, 
rather as an exclamation than interrogation:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How on earth did you know that!&rsquo;&nbsp; His 
companion, taking it as a query, answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir, at your age and with your strength life should be 
a joy; and yet you are sad: Companionship should be a pleasure; 
yet you prefer solitude.&nbsp; That you are brave and unselfish I
know; I have reason, thank God! to know it.&nbsp; That you are 
kindly and tolerant is apparent from your bearing to my little 
child this morning; as well as your goodness of last night, the 
remembrance of which her mother and I will bear to our graves; 
and to me now.&nbsp; I have not lived all these years without 
having had trouble in my own heart; and although the happiness of
late years has made it dim, my gratitude to you who are so sad 
brings it all back to me.&rsquo;&nbsp; He bowed, and Harold, 
wishing to avoid speaking of his sorrow, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are quite right so far as I have a sorrow; and it 
is because of it I have turned my back on home.&nbsp; Let it rest
at that!&rsquo;&nbsp; His companion bowed gravely and went 
on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I take it that you are going to begin life afresh in 
the new country.&nbsp; In such case I have a proposition to 
make.&nbsp; I have a large business; a business so large that I 
am unable to manage it all myself.&nbsp; I was intending that 
when I arrived at home I would set about finding a partner.&nbsp;
The man I want is not an ordinary man.&nbsp; He must have brains 
and strength and daring.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused.&nbsp; Harold 
felt what was coming, but realised, as he jumped at the 
conclusion, that it would not do for him to take for granted that
he was the man sought.&nbsp; He waited; Mr. Stonehouse went 
on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to brains, I am prepared to take the existence of 
such on my own judgment.&nbsp; I have been reading men, and in 
this aspect specially, all my life.&nbsp; The man I have thought 
of has brains.&nbsp; I am satisfied of that, without proof.&nbsp;
I have proof of the other qualities.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused 
again; as Harold said nothing he continued in a manner ill at 
ease:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My difficulty is to make the proposal to the man I 
want.&nbsp; It is so difficult to talk business to a man to whom 
you under great obligation; to whom you owe everything.&nbsp; He 
might take a friendly overture ill.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was but 
one thing to be said and Harold said it.&nbsp; His heart warmed 
to the kindly old man and he wished to spare him pain; even if he
could not accept him proposition:</p>
<p>&lsquo;He couldn&rsquo;t take it ill; unless he was an awful 
bounder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was you I thought of!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought so much, sir;&rsquo; said Harold after a 
pause, &lsquo;and I thank you earnestly and honestly.&nbsp; But 
it is impossible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my dear sir!&rsquo; said the other, chagrined as 
well as surprised.&nbsp; &lsquo;Think again!&nbsp; It is really 
worth your while to think of it, no matter what your ultimate 
decision may be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold shook his head.&nbsp; There was a long silence.&nbsp; 
The old man wished to give his companion time to think; and 
indeed he thought that Harold was weighing the proposition in his
mind.&nbsp; As for Harold, he was thinking how best he could make
his absolute refusal inoffensive.&nbsp; He must, he felt, give 
some reason; and his thoughts were bent on how much of the truth 
he could safely give without endangering his secret.&nbsp; 
Therefore he spoke at last in general terms:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can only ask you, sir, to bear with me and to believe
that I am very truly and sincerely grateful to you for your 
trust.&nbsp; But the fact is, I cannot go anywhere amongst 
people.&nbsp; Of course you understand that I am speaking in 
confidence; to you alone and to none other?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Absolutely!&rsquo; said Mr. Stonehouse gravely.&nbsp; 
Harold went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must be alone.&nbsp; I can only bear to see people on
this ship because it is a necessary way to solitude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You &ldquo;cannot go anywhere amongst 
people&rdquo;!&nbsp; Pardon me.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish to be 
unduly inquisitive; but on my word I fail to 
understand!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold was in a great difficulty.&nbsp; 
Common courtesy alone forbade that he should leave the matter 
where it was; and in addition both the magnificently generous 
offer which had been made to him, and the way in which accident 
had thrown him to such close intimacy with Pearl&rsquo;s family, 
required that he should be at least fairly frank.&nbsp; At last 
in a sort of cold desperation he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot meet anyone . . . There it something that 
happened . . . Something I did . . . Nothing can make it right . 
. . All I can do is to lose myself in the wildest, grimmest, 
wilderness in the world; and fight my pain . . . my shame . . . 
!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A long silence.&nbsp; Then the old man&rsquo;s voice came 
clear and sweet, something like music, in the shelter from the 
storm:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But perhaps time may mend things.&nbsp; God is very 
good . . . !&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold answered out of the bitterness 
of his heart.&nbsp; He felt that his words were laden with an 
anger which he did not feel, but he did not see his way to alter 
them:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing can mend this thing!&nbsp; It is at the 
farthest point of evil; and there is no going on or coming 
back.&nbsp; Nothing can wipe out what is done; what is 
past!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again silence, and again the strong, gentle voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;God can do much!&nbsp; Oh my dear young friend, you who
have been such a friend to me and mine, think of this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;God Himself can do nothing here!&nbsp; It is 
done!&nbsp; And that is the end!&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned his head;
it was all he could do to keep from groaning.&nbsp; The old 
man&rsquo;s voice vibrated with earnest conviction as he 
spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are young and strong and brave!&nbsp; Your heart is
noble!&nbsp; You can think quickly in moments of peril; therefore
your brain is sound and alert.&nbsp; Now, may I ask you a favour?
it is not much.&nbsp; Only that you will listen, without 
interruption, to what, if I have your permission, I am going to 
say.&nbsp; Do not ask me anything; do not deny; do not 
interrupt!&nbsp; Only listen!&nbsp; May I ask this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By all means!&nbsp; It is not much!&rsquo; he almost 
felt like smiling as he spoke.&nbsp; Mr. Stonehouse, after a 
short pause, as if arranging his thoughts, spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me tell you what I am.&nbsp; I began life with 
nothing but a fair education such as all our American boys 
get.&nbsp; But from a good mother I got an idea that to be honest
was the best of all things; from a strenuous father, who, 
however, could not do well for himself, I learned application to 
work and how best to use and exercise such powers as were in 
me.&nbsp; From the start things prospered with me.&nbsp; Men who 
knew me trusted me; some came with offers to share in my 
enterprise.&nbsp; Thus I had command of what capital I could use;
I was able to undertake great works and to carry them 
through.&nbsp; Fortune kept growing and growing; for as I got 
wealthier I found newer and larger and more productive uses for 
my money.&nbsp; And in all my work I can say before God I never 
willingly wronged any man.&nbsp; I am proud to be able to say 
that my name stands good wherever it has been used.&nbsp; It may 
seem egotistical that I say such things of myself.&nbsp; It may 
seem bad taste; but I speak because I have a motive in so 
doing.&nbsp; I want you to understand at the outset that in my 
own country, wherever I am known and in my own work, my name is a
strength.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He paused a while.&nbsp; Harold sat still; he knew that such 
man would not, could not, speak in such a way without a strong 
motive; and to learn that motive he waited.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When you were in the water making what headway you 
could in that awful sea&mdash;when my little child&rsquo;s life 
hung in the balance, and the anguish of my wife&rsquo;s heart 
nearly tore my heart in two, I said to myself, &ldquo;If we had a
son I should wish him to be like that.&rdquo;&nbsp; I meant it 
then, and I mean it now!&nbsp; Come to me as you are!&nbsp; 
Faults, and past, and all.&nbsp; Forget the past!&nbsp; Whatever 
it was we will together try to wipe it out.&nbsp; Much may be 
done in restoring where there has been any wrong-doing.&nbsp; 
Take my name as your own.&nbsp; It will protect you from the 
result of what ever has been, and give you an opportunity to find
your place again.&nbsp; You are not bad in heart I know.&nbsp; 
Whatever you have done has not been from base motives.&nbsp; Few 
of us are spotless as to facts.&nbsp; You and I will show 
ourselves&mdash;for unless God wills to the opposite we shall 
confide in none other&mdash;that a strong, brave man may win back
all that was lost.&nbsp; Let me call you by my name and hold you 
as the son of my heart; and it will be a joy and pleasure to my 
declining years.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As he had spoken, Harold&rsquo;s thought&rsquo;s had at first 
followed in some wonderment.&nbsp; But gradually, as his noble 
purpose unfolded, based as it was on a misconception as to the 
misdoing of which he himself had spoken, he had been almost 
stricken dumb.&nbsp; At the first realisation of what was 
intended he could not have spoken had he tried; but at the end he
had regained his thoughts and his voice.&nbsp; There was still 
wonderment in it, as realising from the long pause that the old 
man had completed his suggestion, he spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I understand aright you are offering me your 
name!&nbsp; Offering to share your honour with me.&nbsp; With me,
whom, if again I understand, you take as having committed some 
crime?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I inferred from what you said and from your sadness, 
your desire to shun your kind, that there was, if not a crime, 
some fault which needed expiation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But your honour, sir; your honour!&rsquo;&nbsp; There 
was a proud look in the old man&rsquo;s eyes as he said 
quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was my desire, is my desire, to share with you what 
I have that is best; and that, I take it, is not the least 
valuable of my possessions, such as they are!&nbsp; And why 
not?&nbsp; You have given to me all that makes life sweet; 
without which it would be unbearable.&nbsp; That child who came 
to my wife and me when I was old and she had passed her youth is 
all in all to us both.&nbsp; Had your strength and courage been 
for barter in the moments when my child was quivering between 
life and death, I would have cheerfully purchased them with not 
half but all!&nbsp; Sir, I should have given my soul!&nbsp; I can
say this now, for gratitude is above all barter; and surely it is
allowed to a father to show gratitude for the life of his 
child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This great-hearted generosity touched Harold to the 
quick.&nbsp; He could hardly speak for a few minutes.&nbsp; Then 
instinctively grasping the old man&rsquo;s hand he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You overwhelm me.&nbsp; Such noble trust and generosity
as you have shown me demands a return of trust.&nbsp; But I must 
think!&nbsp; Will you remain here and let me return to you in a 
little while?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rose quickly and slipped down the iron ladder, passing into
the darkness and the mist and the flying spray.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;AGE&rsquo;S WISDOM</h2>
<p>Harold went to and fro on the deserted deck.&nbsp; All at once
the course he had to pursue opened out before him.&nbsp; He was 
aware that what the noble-minded old man offered him was fortune,
great fortune in any part of the world.&nbsp; He would have to be
refused, but the refusal should be gently done.&nbsp; He, 
believing that the other had done something very wrong, had still
offered to share with him his name, his honour.&nbsp; Such 
confidence demanded full confidence in return; the unwritten laws
which governed the men amongst whom he had been brought up 
required it.</p>
<p>And the shape that confidence should take?&nbsp; He must first
disabuse his new friend&rsquo;s mind of criminal or unworthy 
cause for his going away.&nbsp; For the sake of his own name and 
that of his dead father that should be done.&nbsp; Then he would 
have to suggest the real cause . . . He would in this have to 
trust Mr. Stonehouse&rsquo;s honour for secrecy.&nbsp; But he was
worthy of trust.&nbsp; He would, of course, give no name, no 
clue; but he would put things generally in a way that he could 
understand.</p>
<p>When his mind was so far made up he wanted to finish the 
matter, so he turned to the wheelhouse and climbed the ladder 
again.&nbsp; It was not till he sat in the shelter by his 
companion that he became aware that he had become wet with the 
spray.&nbsp; The old man wishing to help him in his embarrassment
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; Harold began at once; the straightforward 
habit of his life stood to him now:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me say first, sir, what will I know give you 
pleasure.&rsquo;&nbsp; The old man extended his hand; he had been
hoping for acceptance, and this seemed like it.&nbsp; Harold laid
his hand on it for an instant only, and then raised it as if to 
say &lsquo;Wait&rsquo;:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have been so good to me, so nobly generous in your 
wishes that I feel I owe you a certain confidence.&nbsp; But as 
it concerns not myself alone I will ask that it be kept a secret 
between us two.&nbsp; Not to be told to any other; not even your 
wife!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will hold your secret sacred.&nbsp; Even from my 
wife; the first secret I shall have ever kept from 
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;First, then, let me say, and this is what I know will 
rejoice you, that I am not leaving home and country because of 
any crime I have committed; not from any offence against God or 
man, or law.&nbsp; Thank God! I am free from such.&nbsp; I have 
always tried to live uprightly . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; Here a burst 
of pain overcame him, and with a dry sob he added: &lsquo;And 
that is what makes the terrible unfairness of it all!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old man laid a kindly hand on his shoulder and kept it 
there for a few moments.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor boy!&nbsp; My poor boy!&rsquo; was all he 
said.&nbsp; Harold shook himself as if to dislodge the bitter 
thoughts.&nbsp; Mastering himself he went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There was a lady with whom I was very much thrown in 
contact since we were children.&nbsp; Her father was my 
father&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; My friend too, God knows; for almost
with his dying breath he gave sanction to my marrying his 
daughter, if it should ever be that she should care for me in 
that way.&nbsp; But he wished me to wait, and, till she was old 
enough to choose, to leave her free.&nbsp; For she is several 
years younger than I am; and I am not very old yet&mdash;except 
in heart!&nbsp; All this, you understand, was said in private to 
me; none other knew it.&nbsp; None knew of it even till this 
moment when I tell you that such a thing has been.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
He paused; the other said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Believe me that I value your confidence, beyond all 
words!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold felt already the good effects of being
able to speak of his pent-up trouble.&nbsp; Already this freedom 
from the nightmare loneliness of his own thoughts seemed to be 
freeing his very soul.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I honestly kept to his wishes.&nbsp; Before God, I 
did!&nbsp; No man who loved a woman, honoured her, worshipped 
her, could have been more scrupulously careful as to leaving her 
free.&nbsp; What it was to me to so hold myself no one knows; no 
one ever will know.&nbsp; For I loved her, do love her, with 
every nerve and fibre of my heart.&nbsp; All our lives we had 
been friends; and I believed we loved and trusted each 
other.&nbsp; But . . . but then there came a day when I found by 
chance that a great trouble threatened her.&nbsp; Not from 
anything wrong that she had done; but from something perhaps 
foolish, harmlessly foolish except that she did not know . . . 
&rsquo;&nbsp; He stopped suddenly, fearing he might have said 
overmuch of Stephen&rsquo;s side of the affair.&nbsp; &lsquo;When
I came to her aid, however, meaning the best, and as 
single-minded as a man can be, she misunderstood my words, my 
meaning, my very coming; and she said things which cannot be 
unsaid.&nbsp; Things . . . matters were so fixed that I could not
explain; and I had to listen.&nbsp; She said things that I did 
not believe she could have said to me, to anyone.&nbsp; Things 
that I did not think she could have thought . . . I dare say she 
was right in some ways.&nbsp; I suppose I bungled in my desire to
be unselfish.&nbsp; What she said came to me in new lights upon 
what I had done . . . But anyhow her statements were such that I 
felt I could not, should not, remain.&nbsp; My very presence must
have been a trouble to her hereafter.&nbsp; There was nothing for
it but to come away.&nbsp; There was no place for me!&nbsp; No 
hope for me!&nbsp; There is none on this side of the grave! . . .
For I love her still, more than ever.&nbsp; I honour and worship 
her still, and ever will, and ever must! . . . I am content to 
forego my own happiness; but I feel there is a danger to her from
what has been.&nbsp; That there is and must be to her unhappiness
even from the fact that it was I who was the object of her wrath;
and this adds to my woe.&nbsp; Worst of all is . . . the thought 
and the memory that she should have done so; she who . . . she . 
. . &rsquo;</p>
<p>He turned away overcome and hid his face in his hands.&nbsp; 
The old man sat still; he knew that at such a moment silence is 
the best form of sympathy.&nbsp; But his heart glowed; the wisdom
of his years told him that he had heard as yet of no absolute bar
to his friend&rsquo;s ultimate happiness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am rejoiced, my dear boy, at what you tell me of your
own conduct.&nbsp; It would have made no difference to me had it 
been otherwise.&nbsp; But it would have meant a harder and longer
climb back to the place you should hold.&nbsp; But it really 
seems that nothing is so hopeless as you think.&nbsp; Believe me,
my dear young friend who are now as a son to my heart, that there
will be bright days for you yet . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; He paused a 
moment, but mastering himself went on in a quiet voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think you are wise to go away.&nbsp; In the solitudes
and in danger things that are little in reality will find their 
true perspective; and things that are worthy will appear in their
constant majesty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stood, and laying once again his hand on the young 
man&rsquo;s shoulder said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I recognise that I&mdash;that we, for my wife and 
little girl would be at one with me in my wish, did they know of 
it, must not keep you from your purpose of fighting out your 
trouble alone.&nbsp; Every man, as the Scotch proverb says, must 
&ldquo;dree his own weird.&rdquo;&nbsp; I shall not, I must not, 
ask you for any promise; but I trust that if ever you do come 
back you will make us all glad by seeing you.&nbsp; And remember 
that what I said of myself and of all I 
have&mdash;all&mdash;holds good so long as I shall 
live!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Before Harold could reply he had slipped down the ladder and 
was gone.</p>
<p>During the rest of the voyage, with the exception of one 
occasion, he did not allude to the subject again by word or 
implication, and Harold was grateful to him for it.</p>
<p>On the night before Fire Island should be sighted Harold was 
in the bow of the great ship looking out with eyes in which 
gleamed no hope.&nbsp; To him came through the darkness Mr. 
Stonehouse.&nbsp; He heard the footsteps and knew them; so with 
the instinct of courtesy, knowing that his friend would not 
intrude on his solitude without purpose, he turned and met 
him.&nbsp; When the American stood beside him he said, studiously
avoiding looking at his companion:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the last night we shall be together, and, if I 
may, there is one thing I would like to say to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say all you like, sir,&rsquo; said Harold as heartily 
as he could, &lsquo;I am sure it is well meant; and for that at 
any rate I shall be grateful to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will yet be grateful, I think!&rsquo; he answered 
gravely.&nbsp; &lsquo;When it comes back to you in loneliness and
solitude you will, I believe, think it worth being grateful 
for.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean that you will be grateful to me, 
but for the thing itself.&nbsp; I speak out of the wisdom of many
years.&nbsp; At your time of life the knowledge cannot come from 
observation.&nbsp; It may my poor boy, come through pain; and if 
what I think is correct you will even in due time be grateful to 
the pain which left such golden residuum.&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused,
and Harold grew interested.&nbsp; There was something in the old 
man&rsquo;s manner which presaged a truth; he, at least, believed
it.&nbsp; So the young man listened at first with his ears; and 
as the other spoke, his heart listened too:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Young men are apt to think somewhat wrongly of women 
they love and respect.&nbsp; We are apt to think that such women 
are of a different clay from ourselves.&nbsp; Nay! that they are 
not compact of clay at all, but of some faultless, flawless 
material which the Almighty keeps for such fine work.&nbsp; It is
only in middle age that men&mdash;except scamps, who learn this 
bad side of knowledge young&mdash;realise that women are human 
beings like themselves.&nbsp; It may be, you know, that you may 
have misjudged this young lady!&nbsp; That you have not made 
sufficient allowance for her youth, her nature, even the 
circumstances under which she spoke.&nbsp; You have told me that 
she was in some deep grief or trouble.&nbsp; May it not have been
that this in itself unnerved her, distorted her views, aroused 
her passion till all within and around was tinged with the 
jaundice of her concern, her humiliation&mdash;whatever it was 
that destroyed for the time that normal self which you had known 
so long.&nbsp; May it not have been that her bitterest memory 
even since may be of the speaking of these very words which sent 
you out into the wide world to hide yourself from men.&nbsp; I 
have thought, waking and sleeping, of your position ever since 
you honoured me with your confidence; and with every hour the 
conviction has strengthened in me that there is a way out of this
situation which sends a man like you into solitude with a heart 
hopeless and full of pain; and which leaves her perhaps in 
greater pain, for she has not like you the complete sense of 
innocence.&nbsp; But at present there is no way out but through 
time and thought.&nbsp; Whatever may be her ideas or wishes she 
is powerless.&nbsp; She does not know your thoughts, no matter 
how she may guess at them.&nbsp; She does not know where you are 
or how to reach you, no matter how complete her penitence may 
be.&nbsp; And oh! my dear young friend, remember that you are a 
strong man, and she is a woman.&nbsp; Only a woman in her passion
and her weakness after all.&nbsp; Think this all over, my poor 
boy!&nbsp; You will have time and opportunity where you are 
going.&nbsp; God help you to judge wisely!&rsquo;&nbsp; After a 
pause of a few seconds he said abruptly: &lsquo;Good 
night!&rsquo; and moved quickly away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When the time for parting came Pearl was inconsolable.&nbsp; 
Not knowing any reason why The Man should not do as she wished 
she was persistent in her petitions to Harold that he should come
with her, and to her father and mother that they should induce 
him to do so.&nbsp; Mrs. Stonehouse would have wished him to join
them if only for a time.&nbsp; Her husband, unable to give any 
hint without betraying confidence, had to content himself with 
trying to appease his little daughter by vague hopes rather than 
promises that her friend would join them at some other time.</p>
<p>When the <i>Scoriac</i> was warped at the pier there was a 
tendency on the part of the passengers to give Harold a sort of 
public send-off; but becoming aware of it he hurried down the 
gangway without waiting.&nbsp; Having only hand luggage, for he 
was to get his equipment in New York, he had cleared and passed 
the ring of customs officers before the most expeditious of the 
other passengers had collected their baggage.&nbsp; He had said 
good-bye to the Stonehouses in their own cabin.&nbsp; Pearl had 
been so much affected at saying good-bye, and his heart had so 
warmed to her, that at last he had said impulsively:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, darling.&nbsp; If I am spared I shall 
come back to you within three years.&nbsp; Perhaps I will write 
before then; but there are not many post-offices where I am going
to!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Children are easily satisfied.&nbsp; Their trust makes a 
promise a real thing; and its acceptance is the beginning of 
satisfaction.&nbsp; But for weeks after the parting she had often
fits of deep depression, and at such times her tears always 
flowed.&nbsp; She took note of the date, and there was never a 
day that she did not think of and sigh for The Man.</p>
<p>And The Man, away in the wilds of Alaska, was feeling, day by 
day and hour by hour, the chastening and purifying influences of 
the wilderness.&nbsp; Hot passions cooled before the breath of 
the snowfield and the glacier.&nbsp; The moaning of a tortured 
spirit was lost in the roar of the avalanche and the scream of 
the cyclone.&nbsp; Pale sorrow and cold despair were warmed and 
quickened by the fierce sunlight which came suddenly and stayed 
only long enough to vitalise all nature.</p>
<p>And as the first step to understanding, The Man forgot 
himself.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;DE LANNOY</h2>
<p>Two years!</p>
<p>Not much to look back upon, but a world to look forward 
to.&nbsp; To Stephen, dowered though she was with rare personal 
gifts and with wealth and position accorded to but few, the hours
of waiting were longer than the years that were past.&nbsp; Yet 
the time had new and startling incidents for her.&nbsp; Towards 
Christmas in the second year the Boer war had reached its climax 
of evil.&nbsp; As the news of disaster after disaster was flashed
through the cable she like others felt appalled at the sacrifices
that were being exacted by the God of War.</p>
<p>One day she casually read in The Times that the Earl de Lannoy
had died in his London mansion, and further learned that he had 
never recovered from the shock of hearing that his two sons and 
his nephew had been killed.&nbsp; The paragraph concluded: 
&ldquo;By his death the title passes to a distant relative.&nbsp;
The new Lord de Lannoy is at present in India with his regiment, 
the 35th or &lsquo;Grey&rsquo; Hussars, of which he is 
Colonel.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gave the matter a more than passing 
thought, for it was sad to find a whole family thus wiped out at 
a blow.</p>
<p>Early in February she received a telegram from her London 
solicitor saying that he wished to see her on an important 
matter.&nbsp; Her answer was: &ldquo;Come at once&rdquo;; and at 
tea-time Mr. Copleston arrived.&nbsp; He was an old friend and 
she greeted him warmly.&nbsp; She was a little chilled when he 
answered with what seemed unusual deference:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thank your Ladyship for your kindness!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
She raised her eyebrows but made no comment: she was learning to 
be silent under surprise.&nbsp; When she had handed the old 
gentleman his tea she said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My aunt has chosen to remain away, thinking that you 
might wish to see me privately.&nbsp; But I take it that there is
nothing which she may not share.&nbsp; I have no secrets from 
her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He rubbed his hands genially as he replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all; not at all!&nbsp; I should like her to be 
present.&nbsp; It will, I am sure, be a delight to us 
all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Again raised eyebrows; again silence on the subject.&nbsp; 
When a servant answered her bell she told him to ask Miss Rowly 
if she would kindly join them.</p>
<p>Aunt Laetitia and the solicitor were old cronies, and their 
greeting was most friendly.&nbsp; When the old gentlewoman had 
seated herself and taken her cup of tea, Mr. Copleston said to 
Stephen, with a sort of pomposity:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have to announce your succession to the Earldom de 
Lannoy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen sat quite still.&nbsp; She knew the news was true; Mr.
Copleston was not one who would jest on a business subject, and 
too accurate a lawyer to make an error in a matter of fact.&nbsp;
But the fact did not seem to touch her.&nbsp; It was not that she
was indifferent to it; few women could hear such news without a 
thrill.&nbsp; Mr. Copleston seemed at a loss.&nbsp; Miss Rowly 
rose and quietly kissed her, and saying simply, &lsquo;God bless 
you, my dear!&rsquo; went back to her seat.</p>
<p>Realising that Mr. Copleston expected some acknowledgment, 
Stephen held out her hand to him and said quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>After a long pause she added quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, won&rsquo;t you tell us about it?&nbsp; I am in 
absolute ignorance; and don&rsquo;t understand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had better not burden you, at first, with too many 
details, which can come later; but give you a rough survey of the
situation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your title of Countess de Lannoy comes to you through 
your ancestor Isobel, third and youngest daughter of the sixth 
Earl; Messrs Collinbrae and Jackson, knowing that my firm acted 
for your family, communicated with us.&nbsp; Lest there should be
any error we followed most carefully every descendant and every 
branch of the family, for we thought it best not to communicate 
with you till your right of inheritance was beyond dispute.&nbsp;
We arrived independently at the same result as Messrs. Collinbrae
and Jackson.&nbsp; There is absolutely no doubt whatever of your 
claim.&nbsp; You will petition the Crown, and on reference to the
House of Lords the Committee for Privileges will admit your 
right.&nbsp; May I offer my congratulations, Lady de Lannoy on 
your acquisition?&nbsp; By the way, I may say that all the 
estates of the Earldom, which have been from the first kept in 
strict entail, go with the title de Lannoy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>During the recital Stephen was conscious of a sort of bitter 
comment on the tendencies of good fortune.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too late! too late!&rsquo; something seemed to whisper,
&lsquo;what delight it would have been had Father inherited . . .
If Harold had not gone . . . !&rsquo;&nbsp; All the natural joy 
seemed to vanish, as bubbles break into empty air.</p>
<p>To Aunt Laetitia the new title was a source of pride and joy, 
far greater than would have been the case had it come to 
herself.&nbsp; She had for so many years longed for new honours 
for Stephen that she had almost come to regard them as a right 
whose coming should not be too long delayed.&nbsp; Miss Rowly had
never been to Lannoy; and, indeed, she knew personally nothing of
the county Angleshire in which it was situated.&nbsp; She was 
naturally anxious to see the new domain; but kept her feeling 
concealed during the months that elapsed until Stephen&rsquo;s 
right had been conceded by the Committee for Privileges.&nbsp; 
But after that her impatience became manifest to Stephen, who 
said one day in a teasing, caressing way, as was sometimes her 
wont:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Auntie, what a hurry you are in!&nbsp; Lannoy will
keep, won&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, my dear,&rsquo; she replied, shaking her head, 
&lsquo;I can understand your own reticence, for you don&rsquo;t 
want to seem greedy and in a hurry about your new 
possessions.&nbsp; But when people come to my age there&rsquo;s 
no time to waste.&nbsp; I feel I would not have complete material
for happiness in the World-to-come, if there were not a 
remembrance of my darling in her new home!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen was much touched; she said impulsively:</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall go to-morrow, Auntie.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; Let us 
go to-day.&nbsp; You shall not wait an hour that I can 
help!&rsquo;&nbsp; She ran to the bell; but before her hand was 
on the cord the other said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not yet!&nbsp; Stephen dear.&nbsp; It would flurry me 
to start all at once; to-morrow will be time enough.&nbsp; And 
that will give you time to send word so that they will be 
prepared for your coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>How often do we look for that to-morrow which never 
comes?&nbsp; How often do we find that its looked-for rosy tints 
are none other than the gloom-laden grey of the present?</p>
<p>Before the morrow&rsquo;s sun was high in the heavens Stephen 
was hurriedly summoned to her aunt&rsquo;s bedside.&nbsp; She lay
calm and peaceful; but one side of her face was alive and the 
other seemingly dead.&nbsp; In the night a paralytic stroke had 
seized her.&nbsp; The doctors said she might in time recover a 
little, but she would never be her old active self again.&nbsp; 
She herself, with much painful effort, managed to convey to 
Stephen that she knew the end was near.&nbsp; Stephen, knowing 
the wish of her heart and thinking that it might do her good to 
gratify her wish, asked if she should arrange that she be brought
to Lannoy.&nbsp; Feebly and slowly, word by word, she managed to 
convey her idea.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not now, dear one.&nbsp; I shall see it all in 
time!&mdash;Soon!&nbsp; And I shall understand and 
rejoice!&rsquo;&nbsp; For a long time she lay still, holding with
her right hand, which was not paralysed, the other&rsquo;s 
hand.&nbsp; Then she murmured:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will find happiness there!&rsquo;&nbsp; She said no
more; but seemed to sleep.</p>
<p>From that sleep she never woke, but faded slowly, softly 
away.</p>
<p>Stephen was broken-hearted.&nbsp; Now, indeed, she felt alone 
and desolate.&nbsp; All were gone.&nbsp; Father, uncle, 
aunt!&mdash;And&nbsp; Harold.&nbsp; The kingdoms of the Earth 
which lay at her feet were of no account.&nbsp; One hour of the 
dead or departed, any of them, back again were worth them 
all!</p>
<p>Normanstand was now too utterly lonely to be endurable; so 
Stephen determined to go, for a time at any rate, to 
Lannoy.&nbsp; She was becoming accustomed to be called &lsquo;my 
lady&rsquo; and &lsquo;your ladyship,&rsquo; and the new loneness
made her feel better prepared to take her place amongst new 
surroundings.</p>
<p>In addition, there was another spur to her going.&nbsp; 
Leonard Everard, knowing of her absolute loneliness, and feeling 
that in it was a possibility of renewing his old status, was 
beginning to make himself apparent.&nbsp; He had learned by 
experience a certain wisdom, and did not put himself forward 
obtrusively.&nbsp; But whenever they met he looked at her so 
meekly and so lovingly that it brought remembrances which came 
with blushes.&nbsp; So, all at once, without giving time for the 
news to permeate through the neighbourhood, she took her way to 
Lannoy with a few servants.</p>
<p>Stephen&rsquo;s life had hitherto been spent inland.&nbsp; She
had of course now and again been for short periods to various 
places; but the wonder of the sea as a constant companion had 
been practically unknown to her.</p>
<p>Now at her new home its full splendour burst upon her; and so 
impressed itself upon her that new life seemed to open.</p>
<p>Lannoy was on the north-eastern coast, the castle standing at 
the base of a wide promontory stretching far into the North 
Sea.&nbsp; From the coast the land sloped upward to a great 
rolling ridge.&nbsp; The outlook seaward was over a mighty 
expanse of green sward, dotted here and there with woods and 
isolated clumps of trees which grew fewer and smaller as the 
rigour of the northern sea was borne upon them by the easterly 
gales.</p>
<p>The coast was a wild and lonely one.&nbsp; No habitation other
than an isolated fisher&rsquo;s cottage was to be seen between 
the little fishing-port at the northern curve away to the south, 
where beyond a waste of sandhills and strand another tiny 
fishing-village nestled under a high cliff, sheltering it from 
northerly wind.&nbsp; For centuries the lords of Lannoy had kept 
their magnificent prospect to themselves; and though they had 
treated their farmers and cottagers well, none had ever been 
allowed to settle in the great park to seaward of the castle.</p>
<p>From the terrace of the castle only than one building, other 
than the cottage on the headland, could be seen.&nbsp; Far off on
the very crest of the ridge was the tower of an old windmill.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;THE SILVER LADY</h2>
<p>When it was known that Lady de Lannoy had come to Lannoy there
was a prompt rush of such callers as the county afforded.&nbsp; 
Stephen, however, did not wish to see anyone just at 
present.&nbsp; Partly to avoid the chance meeting with strangers,
and partly because she enjoyed and benefited by the exercise, she
was much away from home every day.&nbsp; Sometimes, attended only
by a groom, she rode long distances north or south along the 
coast; or up over the ridge behind the castle and far inland 
along the shaded roads through the woods; or over bleak 
wind-swept stretches of moorland.&nbsp; Sometimes she would walk,
all alone, far down to the sea-road, and would sit for hours on 
the shore or high up on some little rocky headland where she 
could enjoy the luxury of solitude.</p>
<p>Now and again in her journeyings she made friends, most of 
them humble ones.&nbsp; She was so great a lady in her station 
that she could be familiar without seeming to condescend.&nbsp; 
The fishermen of the little ports to north and south came to know
her, and to look gladly for her coming.&nbsp; Their goodwives had
for her always a willing curtsy and a ready smile.&nbsp; As for 
the children, they looked on her with admiration and love, 
tempered with awe.&nbsp; She was so gentle with them, so ready to
share their pleasures and interests, that after a while they came
to regard her as some strange embodiment of Fairydom and 
Dreamland.&nbsp; Many a little heart was made glad by the arrival
of some item of delight from the Castle; and the hearts of the 
sick seemed never to hope, or their eyes to look, in vain.</p>
<p>One friend she made who became very dear and of great 
import.&nbsp; Often she had looked up at the old windmill on the 
crest of the ridge and wondered who inhabited it; for that some 
one lived in it, or close by, was shown at times by the drifting 
smoke.&nbsp; One day she made up her mind to go and see for 
herself.&nbsp; She had a fancy not to ask anyone about it.&nbsp; 
The place was a little item of mystery; and as such to be 
treasured and exploited, and in due course explored.&nbsp; The 
mill itself was picturesque, and the detail at closer 
acquaintance sustained the far-off impression.&nbsp; The roadway 
forked on the near side of the mill, reuniting again the further 
side, so that the place made a sort of island&mdash;mill, 
out-offices and garden.&nbsp; As the mill was on the very top of 
the ridge the garden which lay seawards was sheltered by the 
building from the west, and from the east by a thick hedge of 
thorn and privet, which quite hid it from the roadway.&nbsp; 
Stephen took the lower road.&nbsp; Finding no entrance save a 
locked wooden door she followed round to the western side, where 
the business side of the mill had been.&nbsp; It was all still 
now and silent, and that it had long fallen into disuse was shown
by the grey faded look of everything.&nbsp; Grass, green and 
luxuriant, grew untrodden between the cobble-stones with which 
the yard was paved.&nbsp; There was a sort of old-world quietude 
about everything which greatly appealed to Stephen.</p>
<p>Stephen dismounted and walked round the yard admiring 
everything.&nbsp; She did not feel as if intruding; for the 
gateway was wide open.</p>
<p>A low door in the base of the mill tower opened, and a maid 
appeared, a demure pretty little thing of sixteen or seventeen 
years, dressed in a prim strait dress and an old-fashioned 
Puritan cap.&nbsp; Seeing a stranger, she made an ejaculation and
drew back hastily.&nbsp; Stephen called out to her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, little girl!&nbsp; Will you 
kindly tell me who lives here?&rsquo;&nbsp; The answer came with 
some hesitation:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sister Ruth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who is Sister Ruth?&rsquo;&nbsp; The question came 
instinctively and without premeditation.&nbsp; The maid, 
embarrassed, held hard to the half-open door and shifted from 
foot to foot uneasily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rsquo; she said at last.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Only Sister Ruth, I suppose!&rsquo;&nbsp; It was manifest 
that the matter had never afforded her anything in the nature of 
a problem.&nbsp; There was an embarrassing silence.&nbsp; Stephen
did not wish to seem, or even to be, prying; but her curiosity 
was aroused.&nbsp; What manner of woman was this who lived so 
manifestly alone, and who had but a Christian name!&nbsp; 
Stephen, however, had all her life been accustomed to dominance, 
and at Normanstand and Norwood had made many acquaintances 
amongst her poorer neighbours.&nbsp; She was just about to ask if
she might see Sister Ruth, when behind the maid in the dark of 
the low passage-way appeared the tall, slim figure of a silver 
woman.&nbsp; Truly a silver woman!&nbsp; The first flash of 
Stephen&rsquo;s thought was correct.&nbsp; White-haired, 
white-faced, white-capped, white-kerchiefed; in a plain-cut dress
of light-grey silk, without adornment of any kind.&nbsp; The 
whole ensemble was as a piece of old silver.&nbsp; The lines of 
her face were very dignified, very sweet, very beautiful.&nbsp; 
Stephen felt at once that she was in the presence of no common 
woman.&nbsp; She looked an admiration which all her Quaker 
garments could not forbid the other to feel.&nbsp; She was not 
the first to speak; in such a noble presence the dignity of 
Stephen&rsquo;s youth imperatively demanded silence, if not 
humility.&nbsp; So she waited.&nbsp; The Silver Lady, for so 
Stephen ever after held her in her mind, said quietly, but with 
manifest welcome:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didst thou wish to see me?&nbsp; Wilt thou come 
in?&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen answered frankly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like to come in; if you will not think me 
rude.&nbsp; The fact is, I was struck when riding by with the 
beautiful situation of the mill.&nbsp; I thought it was only an 
old mill till I saw the garden hedges; and I came round to ask if
I might go in.&rsquo;&nbsp; The&nbsp; Silver Lady came forward at
a pace that by itself expressed warmth as she said heartily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed thou mayest.&nbsp; Stay! it is tea-time.&nbsp; 
Let us put thy horse in one of the sheds; there is no man here at
present to do it.&nbsp; Then thou shalt come with me and see my 
beautiful view!&rsquo;&nbsp; She was about to take the horse 
herself, but Stephen forestalled her with a quick: &lsquo;No, no!
pray let me.&nbsp; I am quite accustomed.&rsquo;&nbsp; She led 
the horse to a shed, and having looped the rein over a hook, 
patted him and ran back.&nbsp; The Silver Lady gave her a hand, 
and they entered the dark passage together.</p>
<p>Stephen was thinking if she ought to begin by telling her 
name.&nbsp; But the Haroun al Raschid feeling for adventure 
incognito is an innate principle of the sons of men.&nbsp; It was
seldom indeed that her life had afforded her such an 
opportunity.</p>
<p>The Silver Lady on her own part also wished for silence, as 
she looked for the effect on her companion when the glory of the 
view should break upon her.&nbsp; When they had climbed the 
winding stone stair, which led up some twenty feet, there was a 
low wide landing with the remains of the main shaft of the mill 
machinery running through it.&nbsp; From one side rose a stone 
stair curving with the outer wall of the mill tower and guarded 
by a heavy iron rail.&nbsp; A dozen steps there were, and then a 
landing a couple of yards square; then a deep doorway cut in the 
thickness of the wall, round which the winding stair 
continued.</p>
<p>The Silver Lady, who had led the way, threw open the door, and
motioned to her guest to enter.&nbsp; Stephen stood for a few 
moments, surprised as well as delighted, for the room before her 
as not like anything which she had ever seen or thought of.</p>
<p>It was a section of almost the whole tower, and was of 
considerable size, for the machinery and even the inner shaft had
been removed.&nbsp; East and south and west the wall had been 
partially cut away so that great wide windows nearly the full 
height of the room showed the magnificent panorama.&nbsp; In the 
depths of the ample windows were little cloistered nooks where 
one might with a feeling of super-solitude be away from and above
the world.</p>
<p>The room was beautifully furnished and everywhere were 
flowers, with leaves and sprays and branches where possible.</p>
<p>Even from where she stood in the doorway Stephen had a 
bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the whole countryside; not only of the 
coast, with which she was already familiar, and on which her 
windows at the Castle looked, but to the south and west, which 
the hill rising steep behind the castle and to southward shut 
out.</p>
<p>The Silver Lady could not but notice her guest&rsquo;s genuine
admiration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou likest my room and my view.&nbsp; There is no use 
asking thee, I see thou dost!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen answered with 
a little gasp.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it is the quaintest and most beautiful place I 
have ever seen!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so glad thou likest it.&nbsp; I have lived here 
for nearly forty years; and they have been years of unutterable 
peace and earthly happiness!&nbsp; And now, thou wilt have some 
tea!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen left the mill that afternoon with a warmth of heart 
that she had been a stranger to for many a day.&nbsp; The two 
women had accepted each other simply.&nbsp; &lsquo;I am called 
Ruth,&rsquo; said the Silver Lady.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I am 
Stephen,&rsquo; said the Countess de Lannoy in reply.&nbsp; And 
that was all; neither had any clue to the other&rsquo;s 
identity.&nbsp; Stephen felt that some story lay behind that 
calm, sweet personality; much sorrow goes to the making of 
fearless quietude.&nbsp; The Quaker lady moved so little out of 
her own environment that she did not even suspect the identity of
her visitor.&nbsp; All that she knew of change was a notice from 
the solicitor to the estate that, as the headship had lapsed into
another branch of the possessing family, she must be prepared, if
necessary, to vacate her tenancy, which was one &lsquo;at 
will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was not long before Stephen availed herself of the 
permission to come again.&nbsp; This time she made up her mind to
tell who she was, lest the concealment of her identity might lead
to awkwardness.&nbsp; At that meeting friendship became 
union.</p>
<p>The natures of the two women expanded to each other; and after
a very few meetings there was established between them a rare 
confidence.&nbsp; Even the personal austerity of Quakerdom, or 
the state and estate of the peeress, could not come 
between.&nbsp; Their friendship seemed to be for the life of 
one.&nbsp; To the other it would be a memory.</p>
<p>The Silver Lady never left the chosen routine of her own 
life.&nbsp; Whatever was the reason of her giving up the world, 
she kept it to herself; and Stephen respected her reticence as 
much as she did her confidence.</p>
<p>It had become a habit, early in their friendship, for Stephen 
to ride or walk over to the windmill in the dusk of the evening 
when she felt especially lonely.&nbsp; On one such occasion she 
pushed open the outer door, which was never shut, and took her 
way up the stone stair.&nbsp; She knew she would find her friend 
seated in the window with hands folded on lap, looking out into 
the silent dusk with that absorbed understanding of things which 
is holier than reverence, and spiritually more active than 
conscious prayer.</p>
<p>She tapped the door lightly, and stepped into the room.</p>
<p>With a glad exclamation, which coming through her habitual 
sedateness showed how much she loved the young girl, Sister Ruth 
started to her feet.&nbsp; There was something of such truth in 
the note she had sounded, that the lonely girl&rsquo;s heart went
out to her in abandoned fulness.&nbsp; She held out her arms; 
and, as she came close to the other, fell rather than sank at her
feet.&nbsp; The elder woman recognised, and knew.&nbsp; She made 
no effort to restrain her; but sinking back into her own seat 
laid the girl&rsquo;s head in her lap, and held her hands close 
against her breast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me,&rsquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t
you tell me, dear child, what troubles you?&nbsp; Tell me! 
dear.&nbsp; It may bring peace!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am miserable, miserable, miserable!&rsquo; moaned
Stephen in a low voice whose despair made the other&rsquo;s heart
grow cold.&nbsp; The Silver Lady knew that here golden silence 
was the best of help; holding close the other&rsquo;s hands, she 
waited.&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s breast began to heave; with an 
impulsive motion she drew away her hands and put them before her 
burning face, which she pressed lower still on the other&rsquo;s 
lap.&nbsp; Sister Ruth knew that the trouble, whatever it was, 
was about to find a voice.&nbsp; And then came in a low 
shuddering whisper a voice muffled in the folds of the dress:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I killed a man!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In all her life the Silver Lady had never been so startled or 
so shocked.&nbsp; She had grown so to love the bright, brilliant 
young girl that the whispered confession cut through the silence 
of the dusk as a shriek of murder goes through the silent gloom 
of night.&nbsp; Her hands flew wide from her breast, and the 
convulsive shudder which shook her all in an instant woke Stephen
through all her own deep emotion to the instinct of protection of
the other.&nbsp; The girl looked up, shaking her head, and said 
with a sadness which stilled all the other&rsquo;s fear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t be frightened!&nbsp; It is not 
murder that I tell you of.&nbsp; Perhaps if it were, the thought 
would be easier to bear!&nbsp; He would have been hurt less if it
had been only his body that I slew.&nbsp; Well I know now that 
his life would have been freely given if I wished it; if it had 
been for my good.&nbsp; But it was the best of him that I killed;
his soul.&nbsp; His noble, loving, trusting, unselfish 
soul.&nbsp; The bravest and truest soul that ever had place in a 
man&rsquo;s breast! . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; Her speaking ended with a
sob; her body sank lower.</p>
<p>Sister Ruth&rsquo;s heart began to beat more freely.&nbsp; She
understood now, and all the womanhood, all the wifehood, 
motherhood suppressed for a lifetime, awoke to the woman&rsquo;s 
need.&nbsp; Gently she stroked the beautiful head that lay so 
meekly on her lap; and as the girl sobbed with but little 
appearance of abatement, she said to her softly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me, dear child.&nbsp; Tell me all about it!&nbsp; 
See! we are alone together.&nbsp; Thou and I; and God!&nbsp; In 
God&rsquo;s dusk; with only the silent land and sea before 
us!&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t thou trust me, dear one, and 
speak!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then, as the shadows fell, and far-off lights at sea began
to twinkle over the waste of waters, Stephen found voice and told
without reserve the secret of her shame and her remorse.</p>
<p>At last, when her broken voice had trailed away into gentle 
catchings of the breath, the older woman, knowing that the time 
come for comfort, took her in her strong arms, holding her face 
wet against her own, their tears mingling.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cry on, dear heart!&rsquo; she said as she kissed 
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Cry on!&nbsp; It will do thee 
good!&rsquo;&nbsp; She was startled once again as the other 
seemed for an instant to grow rigid in her arms, and raising her 
hands cried out in a burst of almost hysterical passion:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cry! cry!&nbsp; Oh my God! my God!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then 
becoming conscious of her wet face she seemed to become in an 
instant all limp, and sank on her knees again.&nbsp; There was so
different a note in her voice that the other&rsquo;s heart leaped
as she heard her say:</p>
<p>&lsquo;God be thanked for these tears!&nbsp; Oh, thank 
God!&nbsp; Thank God!&rsquo;&nbsp; Looking up she saw through the
gloom the surprise in her companion&rsquo;s eyes and answered 
their query in words:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! you don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t know 
what it is to me!&nbsp; I have not cried since last I saw him 
pass from me in the wood!&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>That time of confession seemed to have in some way cleared, 
purified and satisfied Stephen&rsquo;s soul.&nbsp; Life was now 
easier to bear.&nbsp; She was able to adapt herself, justifiably 
to the needs of her position; and all around her and dependent on
her began to realise that amongst them was a controlling force, 
far-reaching sympathy, and a dominant resolution that made for 
good.</p>
<p>She began to shake off the gloom of her sorrows and to take 
her place in her new high station.&nbsp; Friends there were in 
many, and quondam lovers by the score.&nbsp; Lovers of all 
sorts.&nbsp; Fortune-hunters there were be sure, not a few.&nbsp;
But no need was there for baseness when the lady herself was so 
desirable; so young, so fair, so lovable.&nbsp; That she was of 
great estate and &lsquo;richly left&rsquo; made all things 
possible to any man who had sufficient acquisitiveness, or a good
conceit of himself.&nbsp; In a wide circle of country were many 
true-lovers who would have done aught to win her praise.</p>
<p>And so in the East the passing of the two years of silence and
gloom seemed to be the winning of something brighter to 
follow.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX&mdash;THE LESSON OF THE WILDERNESS</h2>
<p>In the West the two years flew.&nbsp; Time seemed to go faster
there, because life was more strenuous.&nbsp; Harold, being 
mainly alone, found endless work always before him.&nbsp; From 
daylight to dark labour never ceased; and for his own part he 
never wished that it should.&nbsp; In the wilderness, and 
especially under such conditions as held in Northern Alaska, 
labour is not merely mechanical.&nbsp; Every hour of the day is 
fraught with danger in some new form, and the head has to play 
its part in the strife against nature.&nbsp; In such a life there
is not much time for thinking or brooding.</p>
<p>At first, when the work and his surroundings were strange to 
him, Harold did many useless things and ran many unnecessary 
risks.&nbsp; But his knowledge grew with experience.&nbsp; 
Privations he had in plenty; and all the fibre of his body and 
the strength of his resolution and endurance were now and again 
taxed to their utmost.&nbsp; But with a man of his nature and 
race the breaking strain is high; and endurance and resolution 
are qualities which develop with practice.</p>
<p>Gradually his mind came back to normal level; he had won 
seemingly through the pain that shadowed him.&nbsp; Without 
anguish he could now think, remember, look forward.&nbsp; Then it
was that the kindly wisdom of the American came back to him, and 
came to stay.&nbsp; He began to examine himself as to his own 
part of the unhappy transaction; and stray moments of wonderment 
came as to whether the fault may not, at the very base, have his 
own.&nbsp; He began to realise that it is insufficient in this 
strenuous world to watch and wait; to suppress one&rsquo;s self; 
to put aside, in the wish to benefit others, all the hopes, 
ambitions, cravings which make for personal gain.</p>
<p>Thus it was that Harold&rsquo;s thoughts, ever circling round 
Stephen, came back with increasing insistence to his duty towards
her.&nbsp; He often thought, and with a bitter feeling against 
himself that it came too late, of the dying trust of her 
father:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Guard her and cherish her, as if you were indeed my son
and she your sister . . . If it should be that you and Stephen 
should find that there is another affection between you remember 
I sanction it.&nbsp; But give her time!&nbsp; I trust that to 
you!&nbsp; She is young, and the world is all before her.&nbsp; 
Let her choose . . . And be loyal to her, if it is another!&nbsp;
It may be a hard task; but I trust you, Harold!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here he would groan, as all the anguish of the past would rush
back upon him; and keenest of all would be the fear, suspicion, 
thought which grew towards belief, that he may have betrayed that
trust. . . .</p>
<p>At first the side of this memory personal to his own happiness
was faintly emphasised; the important side was of the duty to 
Stephen.&nbsp; But as time went on the other thought became a 
sort of corollary; a timid, halting, blushing thought which 
followed sheepishly, borne down by trembling hope.&nbsp; No 
matter what adventure came to him, the thought of neglected duty 
returned ever afresh.&nbsp; Once, when he lay sick for weeks in 
an Indian wigwam, the idea so grew with each day of the monotony,
that when he was able to crawl out by himself into the sunshine 
he had almost made up his mind to start back for home.</p>
<p>Luck is a strange thing.&nbsp; It seems in some mysterious way
to be the divine machinery for adjusting averages.&nbsp; Whatever
may be the measure of happiness or unhappiness, good or evil, 
allotted to anyone, luck is the cause or means of 
counter-balancing so that the main result reaches the standard 
set.</p>
<p>From the time of Harold&rsquo;s illness Dame Fortune seemed to
change her attitude to him.&nbsp; The fierce frown, nay! the 
malignant scowl, to which he had become accustomed, changed to a 
smile.&nbsp; Hitherto everything seemed to have gone wrong with 
him; but now all at once all seemed to go right.&nbsp; He grew 
strong and hardy again.&nbsp; Indeed, he seemed by contrast to 
his late helplessness to be so strong and hard that it looked as 
if that very illness had done him good instead of harm.&nbsp; 
Game was plentiful, and he never seemed to want.&nbsp; Everywhere
he went there were traces of gold, as though by some instinct he 
was tracking it to its home.&nbsp; He did not value gold for its 
own sake; but he did for the ardour of the search.&nbsp; Harold 
was essentially a man, and as a man an adventurer.&nbsp; To such 
a man of such a race adventure is the very salt of existence.</p>
<p>The adventurer&rsquo;s instinct took with it the 
adventurer&rsquo;s judgment; Harold was not content with small 
results.&nbsp; Amidst the vast primeval forces there were, he 
felt, vast results of their prehistoric working; and he 
determined to find some of them.&nbsp; In such a quest, purpose 
is much.&nbsp; It was hardly any wonder, then, that in time 
Harold found himself alone in the midst of one of the great 
treasure-places of the world.&nbsp; Only labour was needed to 
take from the earth riches beyond the dreams of avarice.&nbsp; 
But that labour was no easy problem; great and difficult distance
had to be overcome; secrecy must be observed, for even a whisper 
of the existence of such a place would bring a horde of 
desperadoes.&nbsp; But all these difficulties were at least 
sources of interest, if not in themselves pleasures.&nbsp; The 
new Harold, seemingly freshly created by a year of danger and 
strenuous toil, of self-examining and humiliation, of the 
realisation of duty, and&mdash;though he knew it not as 
yet&mdash;of the dawning of hope, found delight in the thought of
dangers and difficulties to be overcome.&nbsp; Having taken his 
bearings exactly so as to be safe in finding the place again, he 
took his specimens with him and set out to find the shortest and 
best route to the nearest port.</p>
<p>At length he came to the port and set quietly about finding 
men.&nbsp; This he did very carefully and very 
systematically.&nbsp; Finally, with the full complement, and with
ample supply of stores, he started on his expedition to the new 
goldfields.</p>
<p>It is not purposed to set out here the extraordinary growth of
Robinson City, for thus the mining camp soon became.&nbsp; Its 
history has long ago been told for all the world.&nbsp; In the 
early days, when everything had to be organised and protected, 
Harold worked like a giant, and with a system and energy which 
from the first established him as a master.&nbsp; But when the 
second year of his exile was coming to a close, and Robinson City
was teeming with life and commerce, when banks and police and 
soldiers made life and property comparatively safe, he began to 
be restless again.&nbsp; This was not the life to which he had 
set himself.&nbsp; He had gone into the wilderness to be away 
from cities and from men; and here a city had sprung up around 
him and men claimed him as their chief.&nbsp; Moreover, with the 
restless feeling there began to come back to him the old thoughts
and the old pain.</p>
<p>But he felt strong enough by this time to look forward in life
as well as backward.&nbsp; With him now to think was to act; so 
much at least he had gained from his position of dominance in an 
upspringing city.&nbsp; He quietly consolidated such outlying 
interests as he had, placed the management of his great estate in
the hands of a man he had learned to trust, and giving out that 
he was going to San Francisco to arrange some business, left 
Robinson City.&nbsp; He had already accumulated such a fortune 
that the world was before him in any way he might choose to 
take.</p>
<p>Knowing that at San Francisco, to which he had booked, he 
would have to run the gauntlet of certain of his friends and 
business connections, he made haste to leave the ship quietly at 
Portland, the first point she touched on her southern 
journey.&nbsp; Thence he got on the Canadian Pacific Line and 
took his way to Montreal.</p>
<p>What most arrested his attention, and in a very disconcerting 
way, were the glimpses of English life one sees reproduced so 
faithfully here and there in Canada.&nbsp; The whole of the past 
rushed back on him so overpoweringly that he was for the moment 
unnerved.&nbsp; The acute feeling of course soon became 
mitigated; but it was the beginning of a re-realisation of what 
had been, and which grew stronger with each mile as the train 
swept back eastward.</p>
<p>At first he tried to fight it; tried with all the resources of
his strong nature.&nbsp; His mind was made up, he assured himself
over and over again.&nbsp; The past was past, and what had been 
was no more to him than to any of the other passengers of the 
train.&nbsp; Destiny had long ago fulfilled itself.&nbsp; Stephen
no doubt had by now found some one worthy of her and had 
married.&nbsp; In no dream, sleeping or waking, could he ever 
admit that she had married Leonard; that was the only gleam of 
comfort in what had grown to be remorse for his neglected 
duty.</p>
<p>And so it was that Harold An Wolf slowly drifted, though he 
knew it not, into something of the same intellectual position 
which had dominated him when he had started on his journeying and
the sunset fell nightly on his despairing face.&nbsp; The life in
the wilderness, and then in the dominance and masterdom of 
enterprise, had hardened and strengthened him into more 
self-reliant manhood, giving him greater forbearance and a more 
practical view of things.</p>
<p>When he took ship in the <i>Dominion</i>, a large cargo-boat 
with some passengers running to London, he had a vague purpose of
visiting in secret Norcester, whence he could manage to find out 
how matters were at Normanstand.&nbsp; He would then, he felt, be
in a better position to regulate his further movements.&nbsp; He 
knew that he had already a sufficient disguise in his great 
beard.&nbsp; He had nothing to fear from the tracing of him on 
his journey from Alaska or the interest of his 
fellow-passengers.&nbsp; He had all along been so fortunate as to
be able to keep his identity concealed.&nbsp; The name John 
Robinson told nothing in itself, and the width of a whole great 
continent lay between him and the place of his fame.&nbsp; He was
able to take his part freely amongst both the passengers and the 
officers.&nbsp; Even amongst the crew he soon came to be known; 
the men liked his geniality, and instinctively respected his 
enormous strength and his manifest force of character.&nbsp; Men 
who work and who know danger soon learn to recognise the forces 
which overcome both.&nbsp; And as sufficient time had not elapsed
to impair his hardihood or lower his vast strength he was facile 
princeps.&nbsp; And so the crew acknowledged him; to them he was 
a born Captain whom to obey would be a natural duty.</p>
<p>After some days the weather changed.&nbsp; The great ship, 
which usually rested even-keeled on two waves, and whose bilge 
keels under normal conditions rendered rolling impossible, began 
to pitch and roll like a leviathan at play.&nbsp; The decks, 
swept by gigantic seas, were injured wherever was anything to 
injure. Bulwarks were torn away as though they had been compact 
of paper.&nbsp; More than once the double doors at the head of 
the companion stairs had been driven in.&nbsp; The bull&rsquo;s 
eye glasses of some of the ports were beaten from their brazen 
sockets.&nbsp; Nearly all the boats had been wrecked, broken or 
torn from their cranes as the great ship rolled heavily in the 
trough, or giant waves had struck her till she quivered like a 
frightened horse.</p>
<p>At that season she sailed on the far northern course.&nbsp; 
Driven still farther north by the gales, she came within a short 
way of south of Greenland.&nbsp; Then avoiding Moville, which 
should have been her place of call, she ran down the east of 
Britain, the wild weather still prevailing.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI&mdash;THE LIFE-LINE</h2>
<p>On the coast of Angleshire the weather in the early days of 
September had been stormy.&nbsp; With the south-west wind had 
come deluges of rain, not a common thing for the time of year on 
the east coast.&nbsp; Stephen, whose spirits always rose with 
high wind, was in a condition of prolonged excitement.&nbsp; She 
could not keep still; every day she rode long distances, and 
found a wonderful satisfaction in facing the strong winds.&nbsp; 
Like a true horsewoman she did not mind the wet, and had glorious
gallops over the grassy ridge and down the slopes on the farther 
side, out on the open road or through the endless grass rides 
amid the pine woods.</p>
<p>On the Tuesday morning the storm was in full sweep, and 
Stephen was in wild spirits.&nbsp; Nothing would do her but to go
out on the tower of the castle where she could walk about, and 
leaning on the crenellated parapet look over all the coast 
stretching far in front and sweeping away to the left and 
right.&nbsp; The prospect so enchanted her, and the fierce sweep 
of the wind so suited her exalted mood, that she remained there 
all the morning.&nbsp; The whole coast was a mass of leaping foam
and flying spray, and far away to the horizon white-topped waves 
rolled endlessly.&nbsp; That day she did not even ride out, but 
contented herself with watching the sea and the storm from the 
tower.&nbsp; After lunch she went to her tower again; and again 
after tea.&nbsp; The storm was now furious.&nbsp; She made up her
mind that after dinner she would ride down and see its happenings
close at hand.</p>
<p>When she had finished dinner she went to her room to dress for
her ride.&nbsp; The rush and roar of the storm were in her ears, 
and she was in wild tumultuous spirits.&nbsp; All her youth 
seemed to sweep back on her; or perhaps it was that the sickness 
of the last two years was swept away.&nbsp; Somewhere deep down 
in Stephen&rsquo;s heart, below her intention or even her 
consciousness, was a desire to be her old self if only for an 
hour.&nbsp; And to this end externals were of help.&nbsp; Without
weighing the matter in her mind, and acting entirely on impulse, 
she told her maid to get the red habit she had not worn for 
years.&nbsp; When she was dressed she sent round to have out her 
white Arab; while it was getting ready she went once more to the 
tower to see the storm-effect in the darkening twilight.&nbsp; As
she looked, her heart for an instant stood still.&nbsp; Half-way 
to the horizon a great ship, ablaze in the bows, was driving 
through the waves with all her speed.&nbsp; She was heading 
towards the little port, beyond which the shallows sent up a 
moving wall of white spray.</p>
<p>Stephen tore down the turret stair, and gave hurried 
directions to have beds prepared in a number of rooms, fires 
everywhere, and plenty of provisions.&nbsp; She also ordered that
carriages should be sent at once to the fishing port with 
clothing and restoratives.&nbsp; There would, she felt, be need 
for such help before a time to be measured by minutes should have
passed; and as some of her servants were as yet strange to her 
ways she did not leave anything to chance.&nbsp; One carriage was
to go for the doctor who lived at Lannoy, the village over the 
hill, whence nothing could be seen of what was happening.&nbsp; 
She knew that others within sight or hailing would be already on 
their way.&nbsp; Work was afoot, and had she time, or thought of 
it, she would have chosen a more sedate garb.&nbsp; But in the 
excitement no thought of herself came to her.</p>
<p>In a few seconds she was in the saddle, tearing at full speed 
down the road that led to the port.&nbsp; The wind was blowing so
strongly in her face that only in the lulls could she hear the 
hoof-strokes of the groom&rsquo;s horse galloping behind her.</p>
<p>At first the height of the road allowed her to see the ship 
and the port towards which she was making.&nbsp; But presently 
the road dipped, and the curving of the hill shut both from her 
sight; it was only when she came close that she could see either 
again.</p>
<p>Now the great ship was close at hand.&nbsp; The flames had 
gained terribly, and it was a race for life or death.&nbsp; There
was no time do more than run her aground if life was to be saved 
at all.&nbsp; The captain, who in the gaps of the smoke could be 
seen upon the bridge, knew his work well.&nbsp; As he came near 
the shoal he ran a little north, and then turned sharply so as to
throw the boat&rsquo;s head to the south of the shoal.&nbsp; Thus
the wind would drive fire and smoke forward and leave the after 
part of the vessel free for a time.</p>
<p>The shock of her striking the sand was terrific, though the 
tinkle of the bell borne in on the gale showed that the engines 
had been slowed down.&nbsp; The funnels were shaken down, and the
masts broke off, falling forward.&nbsp; A wild shriek from a 
hundred throats cleft the roaring of wind and wave.&nbsp; The 
mast fell, the foremast, with all its cumbering top-hamper on the
bridge, which was in an instant blotted out of existence, 
together with the little band of gallant men who stood on it, 
true to their last duty.&nbsp; As the wind took the smoke south a
man was seen to climb on the wreck of the mast aft and make fast 
the end of a great coil of rope which he carried.&nbsp; He was a 
huge man with a full dark beard.&nbsp; Two sailors working with 
furious haste helped him with the rope.&nbsp; The waves kept 
raising the ship a little, each time bumping her on the sand with
a shock.&nbsp; The people on deck held frantically to the 
wreckage around them.</p>
<p>Then the bearded man, stripping to his waist and cutting off 
his trousers above the knee, fastened an end of the rope round 
his waist.&nbsp; The sailors stood ready one behind the other to 
pay it out.&nbsp; As a great wave rolled under the ship, he threw
himself into the sea.</p>
<p>In the meantime the coastguard had fixed Board of Trade 
rocket-apparatus, and in a few seconds the prolonged roar of a 
rocket was heard.&nbsp; It flew straight towards the ship, rising
at a high angle so as to fall beyond it.&nbsp; But the force of 
the wind took it up as it rose, and the gale increased so that it
rose nearly vertically; and in this position the wind threw it 
south of its objective, and short of it.&nbsp; Another rocket was
got ready at once, and blue lights were burned so that the course
of the venturous swimmer might be noted.&nbsp; He swam strongly; 
but the great weight of the rope behind kept pulling him back, 
and the southern trend of the tide current and the force of the 
wind kept dragging him from the pier.&nbsp; Within the bar the 
waves were much less than without; but they were still so unruly 
that no boat in the harbour&mdash;which was not a lifeboat 
station&mdash;could venture out.&nbsp; Indeed, in the teeth of 
the storm it would have been a physical impossibility to have 
driven one seaward.</p>
<p>As the gathered crowd saw Stephen approach they made way for 
her.&nbsp; She had left her horse with the groom, and despite the
drenching spray fought a way against the wind out on the 
pier.&nbsp; As in the glare of the blue light, which brought many
things into harsh unnatural perspective, she caught sight of the 
set face of the swimmer rising and falling with the waves, her 
heart leaped.&nbsp; This was indeed a man! a brave man; and all 
the woman in her went out to him.&nbsp; For him, and to aid him 
and his work, she would have given everything, done anything; and
in her heart, which beat in an ecstasy of anxiety, she prayed 
with that desperate conviction of hope which comes in such 
moments of exaltation.</p>
<p>But it soon became apparent that no landing could be 
effected.&nbsp; The force of the current and the wind were taking
the man too far southward for him ever to win a way back.&nbsp; 
Then one of coastguards took the lead-topped cane which they use 
for throwing practice, and, after carefully coiling the line 
attached it so that it would run free, managed with a desperate 
effort to fling it far out.&nbsp; The swimmer, to whom it fell 
close, fought towards it frantically; and as the cord began to 
run through the water, managed to grasp it.&nbsp; A wild cheer 
rose from the shore and the ship.&nbsp; A stout line was fastened
to the shore end of the cord, and the swimmer drew it out to 
him.&nbsp; He bent it on the rope which trailed behind him; then,
seeing that he was himself a drag on it, with the knife which he 
drew from the sheath at the back of his waist, he cut himself 
free.&nbsp; One of the coastguards on the pier, helped by a host 
of willing hands, began drawing the end of the rope on 
shore.&nbsp; The swimmer still held the line thrown to him, and 
several men on the pier began to draw on it.&nbsp; Unhappily the 
thin cord broke under the strain, and within a few seconds the 
swimmer had drifted out of possible help.&nbsp; Seeing that only 
wild rocks lay south of the sea-wall, and that on them seas beat 
furiously, he turned and made out for sea.&nbsp; In the light 
beyond the glare he could see vaguely the shore bending away to 
the west in a deep curve of unbroken white leaping foam.&nbsp; 
There was no hope of landing there.&nbsp; To the south was the 
headland, perhaps two miles away as the crow flies.&nbsp; Here 
was the only chance for him.&nbsp; If he could round the 
headland, he might find shelter beyond; or somewhere along the 
farther shore some opening might present itself.&nbsp; Whilst the
light from the blue fires still reached him he turned and made 
for the headland.</p>
<p>In the meantime on ship and on shore men worked 
desperately.&nbsp; Before long the end of the hawser was carried 
round on the high cliff, and pulled as taut as the force at hand 
could manage, and made fast.&nbsp; Soon endless ropes were 
bringing in passengers and crew as fast as place could be found 
for them.&nbsp; It became simply a race for time.&nbsp; If the 
fire, working against the wind, did not reach the hawser, and if 
the ship lasted the furious bumping on the sandbank, which 
threatened to shake her to pieces each moment, all on board might
yet be saved.</p>
<p>Stephen&rsquo;s concern was now for the swimmer alone.&nbsp; 
Such a gallant soul should not perish without help, if help could
be on this side of heaven.&nbsp; She asked the harbour-master, an
old fisherman who knew every inch of the coast for miles, if 
anything could be done.&nbsp; He shook his head sadly as he 
answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear no, my lady.&nbsp; The lifeboat from Granport is
up north, no boat from here could get outside the harbour.&nbsp; 
There&rsquo;s never a spot in the bay where he could land, even 
in a less troubled sea than this.&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; the wind 
ashore, there&rsquo;s no hope for ship or man here that cannot 
round the point.&nbsp; And a stranger is no like to do 
that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; she asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because, my lady, there&rsquo;s a wheen o&rsquo; sunken
rocks beyond the Head.&nbsp; No one that didn&rsquo;t know would 
ever think to keep out beyond them, for the cliff itself goes 
down sheer.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a gallant soul yon; an&rsquo; 
it&rsquo;s a sore pity he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to his death.&nbsp;
But it must be!&nbsp; God can save him if He wishes; but I fear 
none other!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke rose to Stephen&rsquo;s mind a memory of an 
old churchyard with great trees and the scent of many flowers, 
and a child&rsquo;s voice that sounded harsh through the 
monotonous hum of bees:</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be God, and able to do things!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Oh; to be God, if but an hour; and able to do things!&nbsp; To
do anything to help a brave man!&nbsp; A wild prayer surged up in
the girl&rsquo;s heart:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! God, give me this man&rsquo;s life!&nbsp; Give it 
to me to atone for the other I destroyed!&nbsp; Let me but help 
him, and do with me as Thou wilt!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The passion of her prayer seemed to help her, and her brain 
cleared.&nbsp; Surely something could be done!&nbsp; She would do
what she could; but first she must understand the 
situation.&nbsp; She turned again to the old harbour-master:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long would it take him to reach the headland, if he
can swim so far?&rsquo;&nbsp; The answer came with a settled 
conviction bearing hope with it:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wind and tide are wi&rsquo; him, an&rsquo; 
he&rsquo;s a strong swimmer.&nbsp; Perhaps half an hour will take
him there.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s all right in himself.&nbsp; He can 
swim it, sure.&nbsp; But alack! it&rsquo;s when he gets there his
trouble will be, when none can warn him.&nbsp; Look how the waves
are lashing the cliff; and mark the white water beyond!&nbsp; 
What voice can sound to him out in those deeps?&nbsp; How could 
he see if even one were there to warn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here was a hope at any rate.&nbsp; Light and sound were the 
factors of safety.&nbsp; Some good might be effected if she could
get a trumpet; and there were trumpets in the rocket-cart.&nbsp; 
Light could be had&mdash;must be had if all the fences round the 
headland had to be gathered for a bonfire!&nbsp; There was not a 
moment to be lost.&nbsp; She ran to the rocket-cart, and got a 
trumpet from the man in charge.&nbsp; Then she ran to where she 
had left her horse.&nbsp; She had plenty of escort, for by this 
time many gentlemen had arrived on horseback from outlying 
distances, and all offered their services.&nbsp; She thanked them
and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may be useful here.&nbsp; When all these are ashore
send on the rocket-cart, and come yourselves to the headland as 
quick as you can.&nbsp; Tell the coastguards that all those saved
are to be taken to the castle.&nbsp; In the rocket-cart bring 
pitch and tar and oil, and anything that will flame.&nbsp; 
Stay!&rsquo; she cried to the chief boatman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give me
some blue lights!&rsquo;&nbsp; His answer chilled her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, my lady, but they are all used.&nbsp; 
There are the last of them burning now.&nbsp; We have burned them
ever since that man began to swim ashore.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then hurry on the rocket-cart!&rsquo; she said as she 
sprang to the saddle, and swept out on the rough track that ran 
by the cliffs, following in bold curves the windings of the 
shore.&nbsp; The white Arab seemed to know that his speed was 
making for life.&nbsp; As he swept along, far outdistancing the 
groom, Stephen&rsquo;s heart went out in silent words which 
seemed to keep time to the gallop:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, to be God, and be able to do things!&nbsp; Give me 
this man&rsquo;s life, oh, God!&nbsp; Give me this man&rsquo;s 
life, to atone for that noble one which I destroyed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Faster and faster, over rough road, cattle track, and grassy 
sward; over rising and falling ground; now and again so close to 
the edge of the high cliff that the spume swept up the gulleys in
the rocks like a snowstorm, the white Arab swept round the curve 
of the bay, and came out on the high headland where stood the 
fisher&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; On the very brink of the cliff all 
the fisher folk, men, women and children, stood looking at the 
far-off burning ship, from which the flames rose in leaping 
columns.</p>
<p>So intent were all on the cliff that they did not notice her 
coming; as the roar of the wind came from them to her, they could
not hear her voice when she spoke from a distance.&nbsp; She had 
drawn quite close, having dismounted and hung her rein over the 
post of the garden paling, when one of the children saw her, and 
cried out:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lady! the lady! an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s all in 
red!&rsquo;&nbsp; The men were so intent on something that they 
did not seem to hear.&nbsp; They were peering out to the north, 
and were arguing in dumb show as though on something regarding 
which they did not agree.&nbsp; She drew closer, and touching the
old fisherman on the shoulder, called out at his ear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo;&nbsp; He answered without turning, 
keeping his eyes fixed:</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>I</i> say it&rsquo;s a man swimmin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Joe
and Garge here say as it&rsquo;s only a piece o&rsquo; wood or 
sea-wrack.&nbsp; But I know I&rsquo;m right.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a
man swimmin&rsquo;, or my old eyes have lost their 
power!&rsquo;&nbsp; His words carried conviction; the seed of 
hope in her beating heart grew on the instant into certainty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It <i>is</i> a man.&nbsp; I saw him swim off towards 
here when he had taken the rope on shore.&nbsp; Do not turn 
round.&nbsp; Keep your eyes on him so that you may not lose sight
of him in the darkness!&rsquo;&nbsp; The old man chuckled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This darkness!&nbsp; Hee! hee!&nbsp; There be no differ
to me between light and dark.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll watch 
him!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s you, my lady!&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t turn 
round to do my reverence as you tell me to watch.&nbsp; But, poor
soul, it&rsquo;ll not be for long to watch.&nbsp; The Skyres will
have him, sure enow!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We can warn him!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;when he comes 
close enough.&nbsp; I have a trumpet here!&rsquo;&nbsp; He shook 
his head sorrowfully:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah! my lady, what trumpet could sound against that 
storm an&rsquo; from this height?&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s 
heart sank.&nbsp; But there was still hope.&nbsp; If the 
swimmer&rsquo;s ears could not be reached, his eyes might.&nbsp; 
Eagerly she looked back for the coming of the rocket-cart.&nbsp; 
Far off across the deep bay she could see its lamp sway as it 
passed over the rough ground; but alas! it would never arrive in 
time.&nbsp; With a note of despair in her voice she asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long before he reaches the rocks?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Still without turning the old man answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the rate he&rsquo;s going he will be in the sweep of
the current through the rocks within three minutes.&nbsp; If 
he&rsquo;s to be saved he must turn seaward ere the stream grips 
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would there be time to build a bonfire?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no! my lady.&nbsp; The wood couldn&rsquo;t catch in
the time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>For an instant a black film of despair seemed to fall on 
her.&nbsp; The surging of the blood in her head made her dizzy, 
and once again the prayer of the old memory rang in her 
brain:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh to be God, and able to do things!&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the instant an inspiration flashed through her.&nbsp; She, 
too could do things in a humble way.&nbsp; She could do something
at any rate.&nbsp; If there was no time to build a fire, there 
was a fire already built.</p>
<p>The house would burn!</p>
<p>The two feet deep of old thatch held down with nets and 
battened with wreck timber would flare like a beacon.&nbsp; 
Forthwith she spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good people, this noble man who has saved a whole 
shipload of others must not die without an effort.&nbsp; There 
must be light so that he can see our warning to pass beyond the 
rocks!&nbsp; The only light can be from the house.&nbsp; I buy it
of you.&nbsp; It is mine; but I shall pay you for it and build 
you such another as you never thought of.&nbsp; But it must be 
fired at once.&nbsp; You have one minute to clear out all you 
want.&nbsp; In, quick and take all can.&nbsp; Quick! quick! for 
God&rsquo;s sake!&nbsp; It is for a brave man&rsquo;s 
life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The men and women without a word rushed into the house.&nbsp; 
They too knew the danger, and the only hope there was for a 
life.&nbsp; The assurance of the Countess took the sting from the
present loss.&nbsp; Before the minute, which she timed watch in 
hand, was over, all came forth bearing armloads of their lares 
and penates.&nbsp; Then one of the younger men ran in again and 
out bearing a flaming stick from the fire.&nbsp; Stephen nodded, 
he held it to the northern edge of the thatch.&nbsp; The straw 
caught in a flash and the flame ran up the slope and along the 
edge of the roof like a quick match.&nbsp; The squeaking of many 
rats was heard and their brown bodies streamed over the 
roof.&nbsp; Before another minute had passed a great mass of 
flame towered into the sky and shed a red light far out over the 
waste of sea.</p>
<p>It lit up the wilderness of white water where the sea churned 
savagely amongst the sunken rocks; and it lit too the white face 
of a swimmer, now nearly spent, who rising and falling with each 
wave, drifted in the sea whose current bore him on towards the 
fatal rocks.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII&mdash;&lsquo;TO BE GOD AND ABLE TO DO 
THINGS&rsquo;</h2>
<p>When the swimmer saw the light he looked up; even at the 
distance they could see the lift of his face; but he did not seem
to realise that there was any intention in the lighting, or that 
it was created for his benefit.&nbsp; He was manifestly spent 
with his tremendous exertions, and with his long heavy swim in 
the turbulent sea.&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s heart went out to him in
a wave of infinite pity.&nbsp; She tried to use the 
trumpet.&nbsp; But simple as it is, a trumpet needs skill or at 
least practice in its use; she could only make an unintelligible 
sound, and not much even of that.&nbsp; One of the young men 
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me try it, my lady!&rsquo;&nbsp; She handed him the
trumpet and he in turn used with a will.&nbsp; But it was of no 
avail; even his strong lungs and lusty manhood availed nothing in
the teeth of that furious gale.&nbsp; The roof and the whole 
house was now well alight, and the flame roared and leapt.&nbsp; 
Stephen began to make gestures bidding the swimmer, in case he 
might see her and understand, move round the rocks.&nbsp; But he 
made no change in his direction, and was fast approaching a point
in the tide-race whence to avoid the sunken rocks would be an 
impossibility.&nbsp; The old whaler, accustomed to use all his 
wits in times of difficulty, said suddenly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can he understand when we&rsquo;re all between him 
and the light.&nbsp; We are only black shadows to him; all he can
see are waving arms!&rsquo;&nbsp; His sons caught his meaning and
were already dashing towards the burning house.&nbsp; They came 
back with piles of blazing wood and threw them down on the very 
edge of the cliff; brought more and piled them up, flinging heaps
of straw on the bonfire and pouring on oil and pitch till the 
flames rose high.&nbsp; Stephen saw what was necessary and stood 
out of the way, but close to the old whaler, where the light fell
on both of their faces as they looked in the direction of the 
swimmer.&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s red dress itself stood out like a 
flame.&nbsp; The gale tearing up the front of the cliff had 
whirled away her hat; in the stress of the wind her hair was torn
from its up-pinning and flew wide, itself like leaping flame.</p>
<p>Her gestures as she swept her right arm round, as though 
demonstrating the outward curve of a circle, or raising the hand 
above her head motioned with wide palm and spread fingers 
&lsquo;back! back!&rsquo; seemed to have reached the 
swimmer&rsquo;s intelligence.&nbsp; He half rose in the water and
looked about.&nbsp; As if seeing something that he realised, he 
sank back again and began swim frantically out to sea.&nbsp; A 
great throb of joy made Stephen almost faint.&nbsp; At last she 
had been able to do something to help this gallant man.&nbsp; In 
half a minute his efforts seemed to tell in his race for 
life.&nbsp; He drew sufficiently far from dangerous current for 
there to be a hope that he might be saved if he could last out 
the stress to come.</p>
<p>The fishermen kept watch in silent eagerness; and in their 
presence Stephen felt a comfort, though, like her, they could do 
nothing at present.</p>
<p>When the swimmer had passed sufficiently far out to be clear 
of the rocks, the fire began to lose its flame, though not its 
intensity.&nbsp; It would be fiery still for hours to come, and 
of great heat; but the flames ceased to leap, and in the 
moderated light Stephen only saw the white face for one more 
instant ere it faded out of her ken, when, turning, the man 
looked towards the light and made a gesture which she did not 
understand: for he put for an instant both hands before his 
face.</p>
<p>Just then there was a wild noise on the cliff.&nbsp; The 
rocket-cart drawn by sixteen splendid horses, some of them 
hunters, came tearing up the slope, and with it many men on 
horseback afoot.&nbsp; Many of the runners were the gentlemen who
had given their horses for the good work.</p>
<p>As the coastguards jumped from the cart, and began to get out 
the rocket stand, the old whaler pointed out the direction where 
the swimmer&rsquo;s head could still be seen.&nbsp; Some of the 
sailors could see it too; though to Stephen and the laymen it was
invisible.&nbsp; The chief boatman shook his head:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No use throwing a line there!&nbsp; Even if he got it 
we could never drag him alive through these rocks.&nbsp; He would
be pounded to death before twenty fathom!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Stephen&rsquo;s heart grew cold as she listened.&nbsp; Was this 
the end?&nbsp; Then with a bitter cry she wailed:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! can nothing be done?&nbsp; Can nothing be 
done?&nbsp; Can no boat come from the other side of the 
point?&nbsp; Must such a brave man be lost!&rsquo; and her tears 
began to flow.</p>
<p>One of the young men who had just arrived, a neighbouring 
squire, a proved wastrel but a fine horseman, who had already 
regarded Stephen at the few occasions of their meeting with eyes 
of manifest admiration, spoke up:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Lady de Lannoy.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a 
chance for him yet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see what I can 
do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bless you! oh! bless you!&rsquo; she cried impulsively 
as she caught his hand.&nbsp; Then came the chill of doubt.&nbsp;
&lsquo;But what can you do?&rsquo; she added despairingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hector and I may be able to do something 
together.&rsquo;&nbsp; Turning to one of the fishermen he 
asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there any way down to the water in the shelter of 
the point?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay! ay! sir,&rsquo; came the ready answer.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the path as we get down by to our 
boats.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come on, then!&rsquo; he said.&nbsp; &lsquo;Some of you
chaps show us a light on the way down.&nbsp; If Hector can manage
the scramble there&rsquo;s a chance.&nbsp; You see,&rsquo; he 
said, turning again to Stephen, &lsquo;Hector can swim like a 
fish.&nbsp; When he was a racer I trained him in the sea so that 
none of the touts could spy out his form.&nbsp; Many&rsquo;s the 
swim we&rsquo;ve had together; and in rough water too, though in 
none so wild as this!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is a desperate chance for you!&rsquo; said 
Stephen, woman-like drawing somewhat back from a danger she had 
herself evoked.&nbsp; The young man laughed lightly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What of that!&nbsp; I may do one good thing before I 
die.&nbsp; That fine fellow&rsquo;s life is worth a hundred of my
wasted one!&nbsp; Here! some of you fellows help me with 
Hector.&nbsp; We must take him from the cart and get a girth on 
him instead of the saddle.&nbsp; We shall want something to hold 
on to without pulling his head down by using the 
bridle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He, followed by some others, ran to the rocket-cart where the 
horses stood panting, their steam rising in a white cloud in the 
glow of the burning house.&nbsp; In an incredibly short time the 
horse was ready with only the girth.&nbsp; The young squire took 
him by the mane and he followed eagerly; he had memories of his 
own.&nbsp; As they passed close to Stephen the squire said to one
of his friends:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hold him a minute, Jack!&rsquo;&nbsp; He ran over to 
Stephen and looked at her hard:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-bye!&nbsp; Wish me luck; and give us 
light!&rsquo;&nbsp; Tears were in her eyes and a flush on her 
cheek as she took his hand and clasped it hard:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you brave man!&nbsp; God bless you!&rsquo;&nbsp; He
stooped suddenly and impulsively kissed the back of her hand 
lightly and was gone.&nbsp; For a fleeting moment she was 
angry.&nbsp; No man had kissed her hand before; but the thought 
of his liberty was swept away by another:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little enough when he may be going to his 
death!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was a sight to see that man and horse, surrounded by an 
eager crowd of helpers, scrambling down the rough zigzag, cut and
worn in the very face of the cliff.&nbsp; They stumbled, and 
slipped; pebbles and broken rock fell away under their 
feet.&nbsp; Alone close to the bonfire stood Stephen, following 
every movement with racing blood and beating heart.&nbsp; The 
bonfire was glowing; a constant stream of men and women were 
dragging and hauling all sorts of material for its 
increase.&nbsp; The head of the swimmer could be seen, rising and
falling amid the waves beyond the Skyres.</p>
<p>When about twenty feet from the water-level the path jutted 
out to one side left of the little beach whereon the sea now 
broke fiercely.&nbsp; This was a place where men watched, and 
whence at times they fished with rods; the broad rock overhung 
the water.&nbsp; The fire above, though it threw shadows, made 
light enough for everything.&nbsp; The squire held up his 
hand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stop!&nbsp; We can take off this rock, if the water is 
deep enough.&nbsp; How much is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ten fathoms sheer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good!&rsquo;&nbsp; He motioned to them all to keep 
back.&nbsp; Then threw off all his clothes except shirt and 
trousers.&nbsp; For an instant he patted Hector and then sprang 
upon his back.&nbsp; Holding him by the mane he urged him forward
with a cry.&nbsp; The noble animal did not hesitate an 
instant.&nbsp; He knew that grasp of the mane; that cry; that dig
of the spurless heels.&nbsp; He sprang forward with wide dilated 
nostrils, and from the edge of the jutting rock jumped far out 
into the sea.&nbsp; Man and horse disappeared for a few seconds, 
but rose safely.&nbsp; The man slid from the horse&rsquo;s back; 
and, holding by the girth with one hand, swam beside him out to 
sea in the direction the swimmer must come on rounding the sunken
rocks.</p>
<p>A wild cheer broke from all on the cliff above and those 
already scrambling back up the zigzag.&nbsp; Stephen kept 
encouraging the men to bring fuel to the bonfire:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring everything you can find; the carts, the palings, 
the roofs, the corn, the dried fish; anything and everything that
will burn.&nbsp; We must have light; plenty of light!&nbsp; Two 
brave men&rsquo;s lives are at stake now!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whole place was a scene of activity.&nbsp; Stephen stood 
on the edge of the cliff with the old whaler and the chief 
boatman and some of the women.&nbsp; The rest of the coastguards 
were by orders of their chief rigging up a whip which they 
thought might be necessary to hoist the men up from the water, if
they could ever get close enough.&nbsp; One of the young men who 
had ridden with the rocket-cart kept tight hold of Hector&rsquo;s
bridle; he knew it would be wanted if the horse ever had a chance
of landing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>When Harold turned away from the dazzling blue lights on the 
pier, and saw the far white line of the cliffs beyond the bay, 
his heart sank within him.&nbsp; Even his great strength and 
hardihood, won by work and privation in the far North-West, had 
been already taxed in the many days of the battling with the gale
when all on board who could lend a hand were taken into 
service.&nbsp; Again by the frantic struggle of the last hour or 
two, when the ship ran shoreward at the utmost of her speed in 
the last hope of beaching in time to save life.&nbsp; Finally in 
that grim struggle to draw the life-line shoreward.&nbsp; The 
cold and then the great heat, and on top of it the chill of the 
long swim, seemed to have struck at him.&nbsp; Alone on the dark 
sea, for soon the current and his own exertions were taking him 
away from the rocks, the light of the burning ship was ceasing to
be effective.&nbsp; It was just enough to hinder his vision; 
looking from the patch of light which bathed the light and him he
could just see far off the white water which marked the cliff 
fronts, and on the edge of his horizon the grim moving white wall
where the waves broke on the headland.</p>
<p>On and on he toiled.&nbsp; His limbs were becoming more 
cramped with the cold and the terrible strain of swimming in such
waves.&nbsp; But still the brave heart bore him up; and 
resolutely, sternly he forced himself afresh to the effort before
him.&nbsp; He reasoned that where there was such a headland 
standing out so stark into the sea there ought to be some shelter
in its lee.&nbsp; If he could pass it he might find calmer water 
and even a landing-place beyond.</p>
<p>Here at least was hope.&nbsp; He would try to round the point 
at any rate.&nbsp; Now he drew so close that the great rocks 
seemed to tower vast above him.&nbsp; He was not yet close enough
to feel as though lapped in their shadow; but even the overcast 
sky seemed full of light above the line of the cliff.&nbsp; There
was a strange roaring, rushing sound around him.&nbsp; He thought
that it was not merely the waves dashing on the rocks, but that 
partly it came from his own ears; that his ebbing strength was 
feeling the frantic struggle which he was making.&nbsp; The end 
was coming, he thought; but still he kept valiantly on, set and 
silent, as is the way with brave men.</p>
<p>Suddenly from the top of the cliff a bright light 
flashed.&nbsp; He looked at it sideways as he fought his way on, 
and saw the light rise and fall and flicker as the flames 
leaped.&nbsp; High over him he saw fantastic figures which seemed
to dance on the edge of the high cliff.&nbsp; They had evidently 
noticed him, and were making signals of some sort; but what the 
motions were he could not see or understand, for they were but 
dark silhouettes, edged with light, against the background of 
fire.&nbsp; The only thing he could think was that they meant to 
encourage him, and so he urged himself to further effort.&nbsp; 
It might be that help was at hand!</p>
<p>Several times as he turned his head sideways he saw the 
figures and the light, but not so clearly; it was as though the 
light was lessening in power.&nbsp; When again he looked he saw a
new fire leap out on the edge of the cliff, and some figures to 
the right of it.&nbsp; They were signalling in some way.&nbsp; 
So, pausing in his swimming, he rose a little from the water and 
looked at them.</p>
<p>A thrill shot through him, and a paralysing thought that he 
must have gone mad.&nbsp; With his wet hand he cleared his eyes, 
though the touching them pained him terribly, and for an instant 
saw clearly:</p>
<p>There on the edge of the cliff, standing beside some men and 
waving her arms in a wild sweep as though motioning frantically 
&lsquo;Keep out! keep out!&rsquo; was a woman.&nbsp; 
Instinctively he glanced to his left and saw a white waste of 
leaping water, through which sharp rocks rose like monstrous 
teeth.&nbsp; On the instant he saw the danger, and made out 
seaward, swimming frantically to clear the dangerous spot before 
the current would sweep him upon the rocks.</p>
<p>But the woman!&nbsp; As one remembers the last sight when the 
lightning has banished sight, so that vision seemed burned into 
his brain.&nbsp; A woman with a scarlet riding-habit and masses 
of long red hair blowing in the gale like leaping flame!&nbsp; 
Could there be two such persons in the world?&nbsp; No! no!&nbsp;
It was a vision!&nbsp; A vision of the woman he loved, come to 
save him in the direst moment of great peril!</p>
<p>His heart beat with new hope; only the blackness of the stormy
sea was before him as he strove frantically on.</p>
<p>Presently when he felt the current slacken, for he had been 
swimming across it and could feel its power, he turned and looked
back.&nbsp; As he did so he murmured aloud:</p>
<p>&lsquo;A dream!&nbsp; A vision!&nbsp; She came to warn 
me!&rsquo;&nbsp; For as he looked all had disappeared.&nbsp; 
Cliff and coastline, dark rocks and leaping seas, blazing fire, 
and the warning vision of the woman he loved.</p>
<p>Again he looked where the waste of sea churning amongst the 
sunken rocks had been.&nbsp; He could hear the roaring of waters,
the thunder of great waves beating on the iron-bound coast; but 
nothing could he see.&nbsp; He was alone on the wild sea; in the 
dark.</p>
<p>Then truly the swift shadow of despair fell upon him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blind&nbsp; Blind!&rsquo; he moaned, and for the 
moment, stricken with despair, sank into the trough of the 
waves.&nbsp; But the instinctive desire for life recalled 
him.&nbsp; Once more he fought his way up to the surface, and 
swam blindly, desperately on.&nbsp; Seeing nothing, he did not 
know which way he was going.&nbsp; He might have heard better had
his eyes been able to help his ears; but in the sudden strange 
darkness all the senses were astray.&nbsp; In the agony of his 
mind he could not even feel the pain of his burnt face; the 
torture of his eyes had passed.&nbsp; But with the instinct of a 
strong man he kept on swimming blindly, desperately.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It seemed as if ages of untold agony had gone by, when he 
heard a voice seemingly beside him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lay hold here!&nbsp; Catch the girth!&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
voice came muffled by wind and wave.&nbsp; His strength was now 
nearly at its last.</p>
<p>The shock of his blindness and the agony of the moments that 
had passed had finished his exhaustion.&nbsp; But a little longer
and he must have sunk into his rest.&nbsp; But the voice and the 
help it promised rallied him for a moment.&nbsp; He had hardly 
strength to speak, but he managed to gasp out:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where? where?&nbsp; Help me!&nbsp; I am 
blind!&rsquo;&nbsp; A hand took his and guided it to a tightened 
girth.&nbsp; Instinctively his fingers closed round it, and he 
hung on grimly.&nbsp; His senses were going fast.&nbsp; He felt 
as if it was all a strange dream.&nbsp; A voice here in the 
sea!&nbsp; A girth!&nbsp; A horse; he could hear its hard 
breathing.</p>
<p>The voice came again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Steady!&nbsp; Hold on!&nbsp; My God! he&rsquo;s 
fainted!&nbsp; I must tie him on!&rsquo;&nbsp; He heard a tearing
sound, and something was wound round his wrists.&nbsp; Then his 
nerveless fingers relaxed their hold; and all passed into 
oblivion.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII&mdash;THE QUEEN&rsquo;S ROOM</h2>
<p>To Stephen all that now happened seemed like a dream.&nbsp; 
She saw Hector and his gallant young master forge across the 
smoother water of the current whose boisterous stream had been 
somewhat stilled in the churning amongst the rocks, and then go 
north in the direction of the swimmer who, strange to say, was 
drifting in again towards the sunken rocks.&nbsp; Then she saw 
the swimmer&rsquo;s head sink under the water; and her heart grew
cold.&nbsp; Was this to be the end!&nbsp; Was such a brave man to
be lost after such gallant effort as he had made, and just at the
moment when help was at hand!</p>
<p>The few seconds seemed ages.&nbsp; Instinctively she shut her 
eyes and prayed again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh! God.&nbsp; Give me this 
man&rsquo;s life that I may atone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>God seemed to have heard her prayer.&nbsp; Nay, more!&nbsp; He
had mercifully allowed her to be the means of averting great 
danger.&nbsp; She would never, could never, forget the look on 
the man&rsquo;s face when he saw, by the flame that she had 
kindled, ahead of him the danger from the sunken rocks.&nbsp; She
had exulted at the thought.&nbsp; And now . . .</p>
<p>She was recalled by a wild cheer beside her.&nbsp; Opening her
eyes she saw that the man&rsquo;s head had risen again from the 
water.&nbsp; He was swimming furiously, this time seaward.&nbsp; 
But close at hand were the heads of the swimming horse and man . 
. . She saw the young squire seize the man . . .</p>
<p>And then the rush of her tears blinded her.&nbsp; When she 
could see again the horse had turned and was making back again to
the shelter of the point.&nbsp; The squire had his arm stretched 
across the horse&rsquo;s back; he was holding up the 
sailor&rsquo;s head, which seemed to roll helplessly with every 
motion of the cumbering sea.</p>
<p>For a little she thought he was dead, but the voice of the old
whaler reassured her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was just in time!&nbsp; The poor chap was 
done!&rsquo;&nbsp; And so with beating heart and eyes that did 
not flinch now she watched the slow progress to the shelter of 
the point.&nbsp; The coastguards and fishermen had made up their 
minds where the landing could be made, and were ready; on the 
rocky shelf, whence Hector had at jumped, they stood by with 
lines.&nbsp; When the squire had steered and encouraged the 
horse, whose snorting could be heard from the sheltered water, 
till he was just below the rocks, they lowered a noosed 
rope.&nbsp; This he fastened round the senseless man below his 
shoulders.&nbsp; One strong, careful pull, and he was safe on 
land; and soon was being borne up the steep zigzag on the 
shoulders of the willing crowd.</p>
<p>In the meantime other ropes were passed down to the 
squire.&nbsp; One he placed round his own waist; two others he 
fastened one on each side of the horse&rsquo;s girth.&nbsp; Then 
his friend lowered the bridle, and he managed to put it on the 
horse and attached a rope to it.&nbsp; The fishermen took the 
lines, and, paying out as they went so as to leave plenty of 
slack line, got on the rocks just above the little beach whereon,
sheltered though it was, the seas broke heavily.&nbsp; There they
waited, ready to pull the horse through the surf when he should 
have come close enough.</p>
<p>Stephen did not see the rescue of the horse; for just then a 
tall grave man spoke to her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon me, Lady de Lannoy, but is the man to be brought
up to the Castle?&nbsp; I am told you have given orders that all 
the rescued shall be taken there.&rsquo;&nbsp; She answered 
unhesitatingly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly!&nbsp; I gave orders before coming out that 
preparation was to be made for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am Mr. Hilton.&nbsp; I have just come down to do 
lacum tenens for Dr. Winter at Lannoch Port.&nbsp; I rode over on
hearing there was a wreck, and came here with the 
rocket-cart.&nbsp; I shall take charge of the man and bring him 
up.&nbsp; He will doubtless want some special care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you will be so good!&rsquo; she answered, feeling a 
diffidence which was new to her.&nbsp; At that moment the crowd 
carrying the senseless man began to appear over the cliff, coming
up the zig-zag.&nbsp; The Doctor hurried towards him; she 
followed at a little distance, fearing lest she should hamper 
him.&nbsp; Under his orders they laid the patient on the weather 
side of the bonfire so that the smoke would not reach him.&nbsp; 
The Doctor knelt by his side.</p>
<p>An instant after he looked up and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is alive; his heart is beating, though 
faintly.&nbsp; He had better be taken away at once.&nbsp; There 
is no means here of shelter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring him in the rocket-cart; it is the only conveyance
here,&rsquo; cried Stephen.&nbsp; &lsquo;And bring Mr. Hepburn 
too.&nbsp; He also will need some care after his gallant 
service.&nbsp; I shall ride on and advise my household of your 
coming.&nbsp; And you good people come all to the Castle.&nbsp; 
You are to be my guests if you will so honour me.&nbsp; No!&nbsp;
No!&nbsp; Really I should prefer to ride alone!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said this impulsively, seeing that several of the 
gentlemen were running for their horses to accompany her.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;I shall not wait to thank that valiant young 
gentleman.&nbsp; I shall see him at Lannoy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she was speaking she had taken the bridle of her 
horse.&nbsp; One of the young men stooped and held his hand; she 
bowed, put her foot in it and sprang to the saddle.&nbsp; In an 
instant she was flying across country at full speed, in the 
dark.&nbsp; A wild mood was on her, reaction from the prolonged 
agony of apprehension.&nbsp; There was little which she would not
have done just then.</p>
<p>The gale whistled round her and now and again she shouted with
pure joy.&nbsp; It seemed as if God Himself had answered her 
prayer and given her the returning life!</p>
<p>By the time she had reached the Castle the wild ride had done 
its soothing work.&nbsp; She was calm again, comparatively; her 
wits and feelings were her own.</p>
<p>There was plenty to keep her occupied, mind and body.&nbsp; 
The train of persons saved from the wreck were arriving in all 
sorts of vehicles, and as clothes had to be found for them as 
well as food and shelter there was no end to the exertions 
necessary.&nbsp; She felt as though the world were not wide 
enough for the welcome she wished to extend.&nbsp; Its exercise 
was a sort of reward of her exertions; a thank-offering for the 
response to her prayer.&nbsp; She moved amongst her guests, 
forgetful of herself; of her strange attire; of the state of 
dishevelment and grime in which she was, the result of the storm,
her long ride over rough ground with its share of marshes and 
pools, and the smoke from the bonfire and the blazing 
house.&nbsp; The strangers wondered at first, till they came to 
understand that she was the Lady Bountiful who had stretched her 
helpful hands to them.&nbsp; Those who could, made themselves 
useful with the new batches of arrivals.&nbsp; The whole Castle 
was lit from cellar to tower.&nbsp; The kitchens were making 
lordly provision, the servants were carrying piles of clothes of 
all sorts, and helping to fit those who came still wet from their
passage through or over the heavy sea.</p>
<p>In the general disposition of chambers Stephen ordered to be 
set apart for the rescued swimmer the Royal Chamber where Queen 
Elizabeth had lain; and for Mr. Hepburn that which had been 
occupied by the Second George.&nbsp; She had a sort of idea that 
the stranger was God&rsquo;s guest who was coming to her house; 
and that nothing could be too good for him.&nbsp; As she waited 
for his coming, even though she swept to and fro in her 
ministrations to others, she felt as though she trod on 
air.&nbsp; Some great weight seemed to have been removed from 
her.&nbsp; Her soul was free again!</p>
<p>At last the rocket-cart arrived, and with it many horsemen and
such men and women as could run across country with equal speed 
to the horses labouring by the longer road.</p>
<p>The rescued man was still senseless, but that alone did not 
seem to cause anxiety to the Doctor, who hurried him at once into
the prepared room.&nbsp; When, assisted by some of the other men,
he had undressed him, rubbed him down and put him to bed, and had
seen some of the others who had been rescued from the wreck, he 
sought out Lady de Lannoy.&nbsp; He told her that his anxiety was
for the man&rsquo;s sight; an announcement which blanched his 
hearer&rsquo;s cheeks.&nbsp; She had so made up her mind as to 
his perfect safety that the knowledge of any kind of ill came 
like a cruel shock.&nbsp; She questioned Mr. Hilton closely; so 
closely that he thought it well to tell her at once all that he 
surmised and feared:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That fine young fellow who swam out with his horse to 
him, tells me that when he neared him he cried out that he was 
blind.&nbsp; I have made some inquiries from those on the ship, 
and they tell me that he was a passenger, named Robinson.&nbsp; 
Not only was he not blind then, but he was the strongest and most
alert man on the ship.&nbsp; If it be blindness it must have come
on during that long swim.&nbsp; It may be that before leaving the
ship he received some special injury&mdash;indeed he has several 
cuts and burns and bruises&mdash;and that the irritation of the 
sea-water increased it.&nbsp; I can do nothing till he 
wakes.&nbsp; At present he is in such a state that nothing can be
done for him.&nbsp; Later I shall if necessary give him a 
hypodermic to ensure sleep.&nbsp; In the morning when I come 
again I shall examine him fully.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But you are not going away to-night!&rsquo; said 
Stephen in dismay.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you manage to stay 
here?&nbsp; Indeed you must!&nbsp; Look at all these people, some
of whom may need special attention or perhaps treatment.&nbsp; We
do not know yet if any may be injured.&rsquo;&nbsp; He answered 
at once:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I shall stay if you wish it.&nbsp; But there 
are two other doctors here already.&nbsp; I must go over to my 
own place to get some necessary instruments for the examination 
of this special patient.&nbsp; But that I can do in the early 
morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Can I not send for what you want; the whole household 
are at your service.&nbsp; All that can be done for that gallant 
man must be done.&nbsp; You can send to London for special help 
if you wish.&nbsp; If that man is blind, or in danger of 
blindness, we must have the best oculist in the world for 
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All shall be done that is possible,&rsquo; said he 
earnestly.&nbsp; &lsquo;But till I examine him in the morning we 
can do nothing.&nbsp; I am myself an oculist; that is my 
department in St. Stephen&rsquo;s Hospital.&nbsp; I have an idea 
of what is wrong, but I cannot diagnose exactly until I can use 
the ophthalmoscope.&rsquo;&nbsp; His words gave Stephen 
confidence.&nbsp; Laying her hand on his arm unconsciously in the
extremity of pity she said earnestly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, do what you can for him.&nbsp; He must be a noble 
creature; and all that is possible must be done.&nbsp; I shall 
never rest happily if through any failing on my part he suffers 
as you fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall do all I can,&rsquo; he said with equal 
earnestness, touched with her eager pity.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I 
shall not trust myself alone, if any other can be of 
service.&nbsp; Depend upon it, Lady de Lannoy, all shall be as 
you wish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was little sleep in the Castle that night till 
late.&nbsp; Mr. Hilton slept on a sofa in the Queen&rsquo;s Room 
after he had administered a narcotic to his patient.</p>
<p>As soon as the eastern sky began to quicken, he rode, as he 
had arranged during the evening, to Dr. Winter&rsquo;s house at 
Lannoch Port where he was staying.&nbsp; After selecting such 
instruments and drugs as he required, he came back in the 
dogcart.</p>
<p>It was still early morning when he regained the Castle.&nbsp; 
He found Lady de Lannoy up and looking anxiously for him.&nbsp; 
Her concern was somewhat abated when he was able to tell her that
his patient still slept.</p>
<p>It was a painful scene for Mr. Hilton when his patient 
woke.&nbsp; Fortunately some of the after-effects of the narcotic
remained, for his despair at realising that he was blind was 
terrible.&nbsp; It was not that he was violent; to be so under 
his present circumstances would have been foreign to 
Harold&rsquo;s nature.&nbsp; But there was a despair which was 
infinitely more sad to witness than passion.&nbsp; He simply 
moaned to himself:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blind!&nbsp; Blind!&rsquo; and again in every phase of 
horrified amazement, as though he could not realise the truth: 
&lsquo;Blind!&nbsp; Blind!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Doctor laid his hand 
on his breast and said very gently:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor fellow, it is a dreadful thing to face, to 
think of.&nbsp; But as yet I have not been able to come to any 
conclusion; unable even to examine you.&nbsp; I do not wish to 
encourage hopes that may be false, but there are cases when 
injury is not vital and perhaps only temporary.&nbsp; In such 
case your best chance, indeed your only chance, is to keep 
quiet.&nbsp; You must not even think if possible of anything that
may excite you.&nbsp; I am now about to examine you with the 
ophthalmoscope.&nbsp; You are a man; none of us who saw your 
splendid feat last night can doubt your pluck.&nbsp; Now I want 
you to use some of it to help us both.&nbsp; You, for your 
recovery, if such is possible; me, to help me in my work.&nbsp; I
have asked some of your late companions who tell me that on 
shipboard you were not only well and of good sight, but that you 
were remarkable even amongst strong men.&nbsp; Whatever it is you
suffer from must have come on quickly.&nbsp; Tell me all you can 
remember of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor listened attentively whilst Harold told all he 
could remember of his sufferings.&nbsp; When he spoke of the 
return of old rheumatic pains his hearer said involuntarily: 
&lsquo;Good!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold paused; but went on at 
once.&nbsp; The Doctor recognised that he had rightly appraised 
his remark, and by it judged that he was a well-educated 
man.&nbsp; Something in the method of speaking struck him, and he
said, as nonchalantly as he could:</p>
<p>&lsquo;By the way, which was your University?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cambridge.&nbsp; Trinity.&rsquo;&nbsp; He spoke without
thinking, and the instant he had done so stopped.&nbsp; The sense
of his blindness rushed back on him.&nbsp; He could not see; and 
his ears were not yet trained to take the place of his 
eyes.&nbsp; He must guard himself.&nbsp; Thenceforward he was so 
cautious in his replies that Mr. Hilton felt convinced there was 
some purpose in his reticence.&nbsp; He therefore stopped asking 
questions, and began to examine him.&nbsp; He was unable to come 
to much result; his opinion was shown in his report to Lady de 
Lannoy:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am unable to say anything definite as yet.&nbsp; The 
case is a most interesting one; as a case and quite apart from 
the splendid fellow who is the subject of it.&nbsp; I have hopes 
that within a few days I may be able to know more.&nbsp; I need 
not trouble you with surgical terms; but later on if the 
diagnosis supports the supposition at present in my mind I shall 
be able to speak more fully.&nbsp; In the meantime I shall, with 
your permission, wait here so that I may watch him 
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh you are good.&nbsp; Thank you!&nbsp; Thank 
you!&rsquo; said Stephen.&nbsp; She had so taken the man under 
her own care that she was grateful for any kindness shown to 
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said Mr. Hilton.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any 
man who behaved as that fellow did has a claim on any of us who 
may help him.&nbsp; No time of mine could be better 
spent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he went back to the patient&rsquo;s room he entered 
softly, for he thought he might be asleep.&nbsp; The room was, 
according to his instructions, quite dark, and as it was 
unfamiliar to him he felt his way cautiously.&nbsp; Harold, 
however, heard the small noise he made and said quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is I; Hilton.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look round the room and see.&nbsp; Then lock the door 
and come and talk to me if you will.&nbsp; You will pity a poor 
blind fellow, I know.&nbsp; The darkness has come down upon me so
quickly that I am not accustomed to it!&rsquo;&nbsp; There was a 
break in his voice which moved the other.&nbsp; He lit a candle, 
feeling that the doing so would impress his patient, and went 
round the room; not with catlike movement this time&mdash;he 
wanted the other to hear him.&nbsp; When he had turned the key in
the lock, as sharply as he could, he came to the bedside and sat 
down.&nbsp; Harold spoke again after a short pause:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that candle still lit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; Would you like it put out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind!&nbsp; Again I say pity me and 
pardon me.&nbsp; But I want to ask you something privately, 
between our two selves; and I will feel more of equality than if 
you were looking at me, whilst I cannot see you.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr 
Hilton blew out the candle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&nbsp; We are equal now.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you!&rsquo;&nbsp; A long pause; then he went 
on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;When a man becomes suddenly blind is there usually, or 
even occasionally, any sort of odd sight? . . . Does he see 
anything like a dream, a vision?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that I know of.&nbsp; I have never heard of such a 
case.&nbsp; As a rule people struck blind by lightning, which is 
the most common cause, sometimes remember with extraordinary 
accuracy the last thing they have seen.&nbsp; Just as though it 
were photographed on the retina!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you!&nbsp; Is such usually the recurrence of any 
old dream or anything they have much thought of?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not that I know of.&nbsp; It would be 
unusual!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold waited a long time before he spoke 
again.&nbsp; When he did so it was in a different voice; a 
constrained voice.&nbsp; The Doctor, accustomed to take 
enlightenment from trivial details, noted it:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now tell me, Mr. Hilton, something about what has 
happened.&nbsp; Where am I?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In Lannoy Castle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In Angleshire!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who does it belong to?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady de Lannoy.&nbsp; The Countess de Lannoy; they tell
me she is a Countess in her own right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is very good of her to have me here.&nbsp; Is she an
old lady?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No!&nbsp; A young one.&nbsp; Young and very 
beautiful.&rsquo;&nbsp; After a pause before his query:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s she like?&nbsp; Describe her to 
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is young, a little over twenty.&nbsp; Tall and of a
very fine figure.&nbsp; She has eyes like black diamonds, and 
hair like a flame!&rsquo;&nbsp; For a long time Harold remained 
still.&nbsp; Then he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me all you know or have learned of this whole 
affair.&nbsp; How was I rescued, and by whom?&rsquo;&nbsp; So the
Doctor proceeded to give him every detail he knew of.&nbsp; When 
he was quite through, the other again lay still for a long 
time.&nbsp; The silence was broken by a gentle tap at the 
door.&nbsp; The Doctor lit a candle.&nbsp; He turned the key 
softly, so that no one would notice that the door was 
locked.&nbsp; Something was said in a low whisper.&nbsp; Then the
door was gently closed, and the Doctor returning said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Lannoy wants, if it will not disturb you, to ask 
how you are.&nbsp; Ordinarily I should not let anyone see 
you.&nbsp; But she is not only your hostess, but, as I have just 
told you, it was her ride to the headland, where she burned the 
house to give you light, which was the beginning of your 
rescue.&nbsp; Still if you think it better not . . . !&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly like anybody to see me like this!&rsquo; said 
Harold, feebly seeking an excuse.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear man,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;you may be 
easy in your mind, she won&rsquo;t see much of you.&nbsp; You are
all bandages and beard.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll have to wait a while 
before she sees you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t she see me last night?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not she!&nbsp; Whilst we were trying to restore you she
was rushing back to the Castle to see that all was ready for you,
and for the others from the wreck.&rsquo;&nbsp; This vaguely 
soothed Harold.</p>
<p>If his surmise was correct, and if she had not seen him then, 
it was well that he was bandaged now.&nbsp; He felt that it would
not do to refuse to let her see him; it might look 
suspicious.&nbsp; So after pausing a short while he said in a low
voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose she had better come now.&nbsp; We must not 
keep her waiting!&rsquo;&nbsp; When the Doctor brought her to his
bedside Stephen felt in a measure awed.&nbsp; His bandaged face 
and head and his great beard, singed in patches, looked to her in
the dim light rather awesome.&nbsp; In a very gentle voice she 
said kind things to the sick man, who acknowledged them in a 
feeble whisper.&nbsp; The Doctor, a keen observer, noticed the 
change in his voice, and determined to understand more.&nbsp; 
Stephen spoke of his bravery, and of how it was due to him that 
all on the ship were saved; and as she spoke her emotion moved 
her so much that her sweet voice shook and quivered.&nbsp; To the
ears of the man who had now only sound to guide him, it was music
of the sweetest he had ever heard.&nbsp; Fearing lest his voice 
should betray him, he whispered his own thanks feebly and in few 
words.</p>
<p>When Stephen went away the Doctor went with her; it was more 
than an hour before he returned.&nbsp; He found his patient in 
what he considered a state of suppressed excitement; for, though 
his thoughts were manifestly collected and his words were calm, 
he was restless and excited in other ways.&nbsp; He had evidently
been thinking of his own condition; for shortly after the Doctor 
came in he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are we alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want you to arrange that there shall not be any nurse
with me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear sir!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t handicap me, and 
yourself, with such a restriction.&nbsp; It is for your own good 
that you should have regular and constant attention.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I don&rsquo;t wish it.&nbsp; Not for the present at
all events.&nbsp; I am not accustomed to a nurse, and shall not 
feel comfortable.&nbsp; In a few days perhaps . . . &rsquo;&nbsp;
The decided tone of his voice struck the other.&nbsp; Keeping his
own thoughts and intentions in abeyance, even to himself, he 
answered heartily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right!&nbsp; I shall not have any nurse, at 
present.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks!&rsquo;&nbsp; There was relief in the tone which
seemed undue, and Mr. Hilton again took mental note.&nbsp; 
Presently he asked a question, but in such a tone that the Doctor
pricked up his ears.&nbsp; There was a premeditated 
self-suppression, a gravity of restraint, which implied some 
falsity; some intention other than the words conveyed:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It must have been a job to carry me up those 
stairs.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Doctor was doubting everything, but as 
the safest attitude he stuck to literal truth so far as his words
conveyed it:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&nbsp; You are no light weight!&rsquo;&nbsp; To 
himself he mused:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did he know there were stairs?&nbsp; He cannot know
it; he was senseless!&nbsp; Therefore he must be guessing or 
inquiring!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose the Castle is on high ground.&nbsp; Can you 
see far from the windows?&nbsp; I suppose we are up a good 
height?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From the windows you can see all round the 
promontory.&nbsp; But we are not high up; that is, the room is 
not high from the ground, though the Castle is from the 
sea.&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold asked again, his voice vibrating in the 
note of gladness:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are we on the ground floor then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I suppose the gardens are below us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&nbsp; The answer was given quickly, for a 
thought was floating through him: Why did this strong brave man, 
suddenly stricken blind, wish to know whether his windows were at
a height?&nbsp; He was not surprised when his patient reaching 
out a hand rested it on his arm and said in an imploring 
tone:</p>
<p>&lsquo;It should be moonlight; full moon two nights ago.&nbsp;
Won&rsquo;t you pull up the blind and describe to me all you see?
. . . Tell me fully . . . Remember, I am blind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>This somehow fixed the Doctor&rsquo;s thought:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Suicide!&nbsp; But I must convey the inutility of such 
effort by inference, not falsity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Accordingly he began to describe the scene, from the very base
of the wall, where below the balcony the great border was 
glorious with a mass of foliage plants, away to the distant sea, 
now bathed in the flood of moonlight.&nbsp; Harold asked question
after question; the Doctor replying accurately till he felt that 
the patient was building up a concrete idea of his surroundings 
near and far.&nbsp; Then he left him.&nbsp; He stood for a long 
time out in the passage thinking.&nbsp; He said to himself as he 
moved away:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The poor fellow has some grim intention in his 
mind.&nbsp; I must not let him know that I suspect; but to-night 
I will watch without his knowing it!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV&mdash;WAITING</h2>
<p>Mr. Hilton telegraphed at once countermanding, for the 
present, the nurse for whom he had sent.</p>
<p>That night, when the household had all retired, he came 
quietly to his patient&rsquo;s room, and entering noiselessly, 
sat silent in a far corner.&nbsp; There was no artificial right; 
the patient had to be kept in darkness.&nbsp; There was, however,
a bright moonlight; sufficient light stole in through the edges 
of the blinds to allow him, when his eyes grew accustomed, to see
what might happen.</p>
<p>Harold lay quite still till the house was quiet.&nbsp; He had 
been thinking, ever since he had ascertained the identity of 
Stephen.&nbsp; In his weakness and the paralysing despair of his 
blindness all his former grief and apprehension had come bank 
upon him in a great wave; veritably the tide of circumstances 
seemed to run hard against him.&nbsp; He had had no idea of 
forcing himself upon Stephen; and yet here he was a guest in her 
house, without her knowledge or his own.&nbsp; She had saved his 
life by her energy and resource.&nbsp; Fortunately she did not as
yet know him; the bandages, and his act in suppressing his voice,
had so far protected him.&nbsp; But such could not last for 
long.&nbsp; He could not see to protect himself, and take 
precautions as need arose.&nbsp; And he knew well that 
Stephen&rsquo;s nature would not allow her to be satisfied 
without doing all that was possible to help one who had under her
eyes made a great effort on behalf of others, and to whom there 
was the added bond that his life was due to her.&nbsp; In but a 
little time she must find out to whom she ministered.</p>
<p>What then would happen?&nbsp; Her kindness was such that when 
she realised the blindness of her old friend she might so pity 
him that out of the depths of her pity she would forgive.&nbsp; 
She would take back all the past; and now that she knew of his 
old love for her, would perhaps be willing to marry him.&nbsp; 
Back flooded the old memory of her independence and her theory of
sexual equality.&nbsp; If out of any selfish or mistaken idea she
did not hesitate to ask a man to marry her, would it be likely 
that when the nobler and more heroic side of her nature spoke she
would hesitate to a similar act in pursuance of her 
self-sacrifice?</p>
<p>So it might be that she would either find herself once again 
flouted, or else married to a man she did not love.</p>
<p>Such a catastrophe should not happen, whatever the cost to 
him.&nbsp; He would, blind as he was, steal away in the night and
take himself out of her life; this time for ever.&nbsp; Better 
the ingratitude of an unknown man, the saving of whose life was 
due to her, than the long dull routine of a spoiled life, which 
would otherwise be her unhappy lot.</p>
<p>When once this idea had taken root in his mind he had taken 
such steps as had been open to him without endangering the 
secrecy of his motive.&nbsp; Thanks to his subtle questioning of 
the Doctor, he now knew that his room was close to the ground, so
that he would easily drop from the window and steal away with out
immediate danger of any restraining accident.&nbsp; If he could 
once get away he would be all right.&nbsp; There was a large sum 
to his credit in each of two London banks.&nbsp; He would manage 
somehow to find his way to London; even if he had to walk and beg
his way.</p>
<p>He felt that now in the silence of the night the time had 
come.&nbsp; Quietly he rose and felt his way to the door, now and
again stumbling and knocking against unknown obstacles in the 
manner of the recently blind.&nbsp; After each such noise he 
paused and listened.&nbsp; He felt as if the very walls had 
ears.&nbsp; When he reached the door he turned the key 
softly.&nbsp; Then he breathed more freely.&nbsp; He felt that he
was at last alone and free to move without suspicion.</p>
<p>Then began a great and arduous search; one that was infinitely
difficult and exasperating; and full of pathos to the sympathetic
man who watched him in silence.&nbsp; Mr. Hilton could not 
understand his movements as he felt his way about the room, 
opening drawers and armoires, now and again stooping down and 
feeling along the floor.&nbsp; He did not betray his presence, 
however, but moved noiselessly away as the other 
approached.&nbsp; It was a hideously real game of 
blindman&rsquo;s-buff, with perhaps a life as the forfeit.</p>
<p>Harold went all over the room, and at last sat down on the 
edge of his bed with a hollow suppressed groan that was full of 
pain.&nbsp; He had found his clothes, but realised that they were
now but rags.&nbsp; He put on the clothes, and then for a long 
time sat quiet, rocking gently to and fro as one in pain, a 
figure of infinite woe.&nbsp; At last he roused himself.&nbsp; 
His mind was made up; the time for action had come.&nbsp; He 
groped his way towards the window looking south.&nbsp; The 
Doctor, who had taken off his shoes, followed him with catlike 
stealthiness.</p>
<p>He easily threw open the window, for it was already partly 
open for ventilation.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hilton saw him sit on the rail of the balcony and 
begin to raise his feet, getting ready to drop over, he rushed 
forward and seized him.&nbsp; Harold instinctively grappled with 
him; the habit of his Alaskan life amidst continual danger made 
in such a case action swift as thought.&nbsp; Mr. Hilton, with 
the single desire to prevent him from killing himself, threw 
himself backward and pulled Harold with him to the stone 
floor.</p>
<p>Harold, as he held him in a grip of iron, thundered out, 
forgetful in the excitement of the moment the hushed voice to 
which he had limited himself:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you want? who are you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;H-s-s-sh!&nbsp; I am Mr. Hilton.&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold 
relaxed the rigour of his grasp but still held him firmly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How did you come here?&nbsp; I locked my 
door!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been in the room a long time.&nbsp; I suspected 
something, and came to watch; to prevent your rash 
act.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rash act!&nbsp; How?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, man, if you didn&rsquo;t kill, you would at least 
cripple yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How can I cripple myself when the flower-bed is only a 
few feet below?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are other dangers for a man who&mdash;a man in 
your sad state.&nbsp; And, besides, have I no duty to prevent a 
suicide!&rsquo;&nbsp; Here a brilliant idea struck Harold.&nbsp; 
This man had evidently got some wrong impression; but it would 
serve to shield his real purpose.&nbsp; He would therefore 
encourage it.&nbsp; For the moment, of course, his purpose to 
escape unnoticed was foiled; but he would wait, and in due time 
seize another opportunity.&nbsp; In a harder and more determined 
tone than he had yet used he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see what right you have to 
interfere.&nbsp; I shall kill myself if I like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not whilst you are in my care!&rsquo;&nbsp; This was 
spoken with a resolution equal to his own.&nbsp; Then Mr. Hilton 
went on, more softly and with infinite compassion: 
&lsquo;Moreover, I want to have a talk with you which may alter 
your views.&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold interrupted, still playing the 
game of hiding his real purpose:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall do as I wish; as I intend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are injuring yourself even now by standing in the 
draught of that open window.&nbsp; Your eyes will feel it before 
long . . . Are you mad . . . ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold felt a prick like a pin in his neck; and turned to 
seize his companion.&nbsp; He could not find him, and for a few 
moments stumbled through the dark, raging . . .</p>
<p>It seemed a long time before he remembered anything.&nbsp; He 
had a sense of time lapsed; of dreamland thoughts and 
visions.&nbsp; Then gradually recollection came back.&nbsp; He 
tried to move; but found it impossible.&nbsp; His arms and legs 
were extended wide and were tied; he could feel the cord hurting 
his wrists and ankles as he moved.&nbsp; To him it was awful to 
be thus blind and helpless; and anger began to surge up.&nbsp; He
heard the voice of Mr. Hilton close by him speaking in a calm, 
grave, sympathetic tone:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor fellow, I hated to take such a step; but it was
really necessary for your own safety.&nbsp; You are a man, and a 
brave one.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you listen to me for a few 
minutes?&nbsp; When you have heard what I have to say I shall 
release you.&nbsp; In the meantime I apologise for the outrage, 
as I dare say you consider it!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold was 
reasonable; and he was now blind and helpless.&nbsp; Moreover, 
there was something in the Doctor&rsquo;s voice that carried a 
sense of power with it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on! I shall listen!&rsquo;&nbsp; He compelled 
himself to quietude.&nbsp; The Doctor saw, and realised that he 
was master of himself.&nbsp; There were some snips of scissors, 
and he was free.</p>
<p>&lsquo;See! all I want is calm for a short time, and you have 
it.&nbsp; May I go on?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on!&rsquo; said Harold, not without respect.&nbsp; 
The Doctor after a pause spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My poor fellow, I want you to understand that I wish to
help you, to do all in my power to restore to you that which you 
seem to have lost!&nbsp; I can sympathise with your desire to 
quit life altogether now that the best part of it, sight, seems 
gone.&nbsp; I do not pretend to judge the actions of my fellows; 
and if you determine to carry out your purpose I shall not be 
able to prevent you for ever.&nbsp; I shall not try to.&nbsp; But
you certainly shall not do so till you know what I know!&nbsp; I 
had wished to wait till I could be a little more certain before I
took you into confidence with regard to my guessing as to the 
future.&nbsp; But your desire to destroy yourself forces my 
hand.&nbsp; Now let me tell you that there is a possibility of 
the removal of the cause of your purpose.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; gasped Harold.&nbsp; He was 
afraid to think outright and to the full what the other&rsquo;s 
words seemed to imply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I mean,&rsquo; said the other solemnly, &lsquo;that 
there is a possibility, more than a possibility, that you may 
recover your sight!&rsquo;&nbsp; As he spoke there was a little 
break in his voice.&nbsp; He too was somewhat unnerved at the 
situation.</p>
<p>Harold lay still.&nbsp; The whole universe seemed to sway, and
then whirl round him in chaotic mass.&nbsp; Through it at length 
he seemed to hear the calm voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;At first I could not be sure of my surmise, for when I 
used the ophthalmoscope your suffering was too recent to disclose
the cause I looked for.&nbsp; Now I am fairly sure of it.&nbsp; 
What I have since heard from you has convinced me; your having 
suffered from rheumatic fever, and the recrudescence of the 
rheumatic pain after your terrible experience of the fire and 
that long chilling swim with so seemingly hopeless an end to it; 
the symptoms which I have since noticed, though they have not 
been as enlightening to me as they might be.&nbsp; Your disease, 
as I have diagnosed it, is an obscure one and not common.&nbsp; I
have not before been able to study a case.&nbsp; All these things
give me great hopes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God!&nbsp; Thank God!&rsquo; the voice from the 
bed was now a whisper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God! say I too.&nbsp; This that you suffer from 
is an acute form of inflammation of the optic nerve.&nbsp; It may
of course end badly; in permanent loss of sight.&nbsp; But I 
hope&mdash;I believe, that in your case it will not be so.&nbsp; 
You are young, and you are immensely strong; not merely 
muscularly, but in constitution.&nbsp; I can see that you have 
been an athlete, and no mean one either.&nbsp; All this will 
stand to you.&nbsp; But it will take time.&nbsp; It will need all
your own help; all the calm restraint of your body and your 
mind.&nbsp; I am doing all that science knows; you must do the 
rest!&rsquo;&nbsp; He waited, giving time to the other to realise
his ideas.&nbsp; Harold lay still for a long time before he 
spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doctor.&rsquo;&nbsp; The voice was so strangely 
different that the other was more hopeful at once.&nbsp; He had 
feared opposition, or conflict of some kind.&nbsp; He answered as
cheerily as he could:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; I am listening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are a good fellow; and I am grateful to you, both 
for what you have done and what you have told me.&nbsp; I cannot 
say how grateful just yet; hope unmans me at present.&nbsp; But I
think you deserve that I should tell you the truth!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
The other nodded; he forgot that the speaker could not see.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was not intending to commit suicide.&nbsp; Such an 
idea didn&rsquo;t even enter my head.&nbsp; To me, suicide is the
resource of a coward.&nbsp; I have been in too many tight places 
to ever fear that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then in the name of goodness why were you trying to get
out of that window?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wanted to escape; to get away!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In your shirt and trousers; and they are not over 
much!&nbsp; Without even slippers!&rsquo;&nbsp; A faint smile 
curled round the lips of the injured man.&nbsp; Hope was 
beginning to help already.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even that way!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But man alive! you were going to your death.&nbsp; How 
could you expect to get away in such an outfit without being 
discovered?&nbsp; When you were missed the whole countryside 
would have been up, and even before the hue-and-cry the first 
person who saw you would have taken charge of you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know!&nbsp; I know!&nbsp; I had thought of it 
all.&nbsp; But I was willing to chance it.&nbsp; I had my own 
reasons!&rsquo;&nbsp; He was silent a while.&nbsp; The Doctor was
silent too.&nbsp; Each man was thinking in his own way.&nbsp; 
Presently the Doctor spoke:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look here, old chap!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to pry 
into your secrets; but, won&rsquo;t you let me help you?&nbsp; I 
can hold my tongue.&nbsp; I want to help you.&nbsp; You have 
earned that wish from any man, and woman too, who saw the burning
ship and what you did to save those on board.&nbsp; There is 
nothing I would not do for you.&nbsp; Nothing!&nbsp; I 
don&rsquo;t ask you to tell me all; only enough for me to 
understand and help.&nbsp; I can see that you have some 
overpowering wish to get away.&nbsp; Some reason that I cannot 
fathom, certainly without a clue.&nbsp; You may trust me, I 
assure you.&nbsp; If you could look into my face, my eyes, you 
would understand.&nbsp; But&mdash;There! take my hand.&nbsp; It 
may tell you something!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Harold took the hand placed in his, and held it close.&nbsp; 
He pressed his other hand over it also, as though the effect of 
the two hands would bring him double knowledge.&nbsp; It was 
infinitely pathetic to see him trying to make his untrained 
fingers do the duty of his trained eyes.&nbsp; But, trained or 
not, his hands had their instinct.&nbsp; Laying down gently the 
hand he held he said, turning his bandaged eyes in the direction 
of his companion:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall trust you!&nbsp; Are we alone; absolutely 
alone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Absolutely!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have I your solemn promise that anything I say shall 
never go beyond yourself?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I promise.&nbsp; I can swear, if it will make your mind
more easy in the matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you hold most sacred in the world?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Harold had an odd thought; his question was its result.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All told, I should think my profession!&nbsp; Perhaps 
it doesn&rsquo;t seem to you much to swear by; but it is all my 
world!&nbsp; But I have been brought up in honour, and you may 
trust my promise&mdash;as much as anything I could 
swear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right!&nbsp; My reason for wanting to get away was 
because I knew Lady de Lannoy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then after a pause: &lsquo;I should 
have thought that was a reason for wanting to stay.&nbsp; She 
seems not only one of the most beautiful, but the sweetest woman 
I ever met.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is all that!&nbsp; And a thousand times 
more!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then why&mdash;Pardon me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot tell you all; but you must take it that my 
need to get away is imperative.&rsquo;&nbsp; After pondering a 
while Mr. Hilton said suddenly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must ask your pardon again.&nbsp; Are you sure there 
is no mistake.&nbsp; Lady de Lannoy is not married; has not 
been.&nbsp; She is Countess in her own right.&nbsp; It is quite a
romance.&nbsp; She inherited from some old branch of more than 
three hundred years ago.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again Harold smiled; he 
quite saw what the other meant.</p>
<p>He answered gravely</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand.&nbsp; But it does not alter my opinion; 
my purpose.&nbsp; It is needful&mdash;absolutely and imperatively
needful that I get away without her recognising me, or knowing 
who I am.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does not know you now.&nbsp; She has not seen you 
yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is why I hoped to get away in time; before she 
should recognise me.&nbsp; If I stay quiet and do all you wish, 
will you help me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will!&nbsp; And what then?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I am well, if it should be so, I shall steal away,
this time clothed, and disappear out of her life without her 
knowing.&nbsp; She may think it ungrateful that one whom she has 
treated so well should behave so badly.&nbsp; But that 
can&rsquo;t be helped.&nbsp; It is the lesser evil of the 
two.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I must abet you?&nbsp; All right!&nbsp; I will do 
it; though you must forgive me if you should ever hear that I 
have abused you and said bad things of you.&nbsp; It will have to
be all in the day&rsquo;s work if I am not ultimately to give you
away.&nbsp; I must take steps at once to keep her from seeing 
you.&nbsp; I shall have to invent some story; some new kind of 
dangerous disease, perhaps.&nbsp; I shall stay here and nurse you
myself!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold spoke in joyful gratitude:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you <i>are</i> good.&nbsp; But can you spare the 
time?&nbsp; How long will it all take?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some weeks!&nbsp; Perhaps!&rsquo;&nbsp; He paused as if
thinking.&nbsp; &lsquo;Perhaps in a month&rsquo;s time I shall 
unbandage your eyes.&nbsp; You will then see; or . . . 
&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I understand!&nbsp; I shall be patient!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the morning Mr. Hilton in reporting to Lady de Lannoy told 
her that he considered it would be necessary to keep his patient 
very quiet, both in mind and body.&nbsp; In the course of the 
conversation he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything which might upset him must be studiously 
avoided.&nbsp; He is not an easy patient to deal with; he 
doesn&rsquo;t like people to go near him.&nbsp; I think, 
therefore, it will be well if even you do not see him.&nbsp; He 
seems to have an odd distrust of people, especially of 
women.&nbsp; It may be that he is fretful in his blindness, which
is in itself so trying to a strong man.&nbsp; But besides, the 
treatment is not calculated to have a very buoyant effect.&nbsp; 
It is apt to make a man fretful to lie in the dark, and know that
he has to do so for indefinite weeks.&nbsp; Pilocarpin, and 
salicylate of soda, and mercury do not tend towards 
cheerfulness.&nbsp; Nor do blisters on the forehead add to the 
content of life!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I quite understand,&rsquo; said Stephen, &lsquo;and I 
will be careful not to go near him till he is well.&nbsp; Please 
God! it may bring him back his sight.&nbsp; Thank you a thousand 
times for your determination to stay with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So it was that for more than two weeks Harold was kept all 
alone.&nbsp; No one attended him but the Doctor.&nbsp; He slept 
in the patient&rsquo;s room for the whole of the first week, and 
never had him out of sight for more than a few minutes at a 
time.&nbsp; He was then able to leave him alone for longer 
periods, and settled himself in the bedroom next to him.&nbsp; 
Every hour or two he would visit him.&nbsp; Occasionally he would
be away for half a day, but never for more.&nbsp; Stephen rigidly
observed the Doctor&rsquo;s advice herself, and gave strict 
orders that his instructions were to be obeyed.</p>
<p>Harold himself went through a period of mental 
suffering.&nbsp; It was agony to him to think of Stephen being so
near at hand, and yet not to be able to see her, or even to hear 
her voice.&nbsp; All the pain of his loss of her affection seemed
to crowd back on him, and with it the new need of escaping from 
her unknown.&nbsp; More than ever he felt it would not do that 
she should ever learn his identity.&nbsp; Her pity for him, and 
possibly her woman&rsquo;s regard for a man&rsquo;s effort in 
time of stress, might lead through the gates of her own 
self-sacrifice to his restoration to his old place in her 
affections.&nbsp; Nay! it could not be his old place; for at the 
close of those days she had learned of his love for her.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV&mdash;A CRY</h2>
<p>The third week had nearly elapsed, and as yet no one was 
allowed to see the patient.</p>
<p>For a time Stephen was inclined to be chagrined.&nbsp; It is 
not pleasant to have even the most generous and benevolent 
intentions thwarted; and she had set her mind on making much of 
this man whom fate and his own bravery had thrown athwart her 
life.&nbsp; But in these days Stephen was in some ways a changed 
woman.&nbsp; She had so much that she wished to forget and that 
she would have given worlds to recall, that she could not bear 
even to think of any militant or even questioning attitude.&nbsp;
She even began to take herself to task more seriously than she 
had ever done with regard to social and conventional 
duties.&nbsp; When she found her house full of so many and so 
varied guests, it was borne in upon her that such a position as 
her own, with such consequent duties, called for the presence of 
some elder person of her own sex and of her own class.</p>
<p>No better proof of Stephen&rsquo;s intellectual process and 
its result could be adduced than her first act of recognition: 
she summoned an elderly lady to live with her and matronise her 
house.&nbsp; This lady, the widow of a distant relation, complied
with all the charted requirements of respectability, and had what
to Stephen&rsquo;s eyes was a positive gift: that of minding her 
own business and not interfering in any matter whatever.&nbsp; 
Lady de Lannoy, she felt, was her own master and quite able to 
take care of herself.&nbsp; Her own presence was all that 
convention required.&nbsp; So she limited herself to this duty, 
with admirable result to all, herself included.&nbsp; After a few
days Stephen would almost forget that she was present.</p>
<p>Mr. Hilton kept bravely to his undertaking.&nbsp; He never 
gave even a hint of his hopes of the restoration of sight; and he
was so assiduous in his attention that there arose no opportunity
of accidental discovery of the secret.&nbsp; He knew that when 
the time did come he would find himself in a very unpleasant 
situation.&nbsp; Want of confidence, and even of intentional 
deceit, might be attributed to him; and he would not be able to 
deny nor explain.&nbsp; He was, however; determined to stick to 
his word.&nbsp; If he could but save his patient&rsquo;s sight he
would be satisfied.</p>
<p>But to Stephen all the mystery seemed to grow out of its first
shadowy importance into something real.&nbsp; There was coming to
her a vague idea that she would do well not to manifest any 
concern, any anxiety, any curiosity.&nbsp; Instinct was at work; 
she was content to trust it, and wait.</p>
<p>One forenoon she received by messenger a letter which 
interested her much.&nbsp; So much that at first she was 
unwilling to show it to anyone, and took it to her own boudoir to
read over again in privacy.&nbsp; She had a sort of feeling of 
expectancy with regard to it; such as sensitive natures feel 
before a thunderstorm.&nbsp; The letter was natural enough in 
itself.&nbsp; It was dated that morning from Varilands, a 
neighbouring estate which marched with Lannoy to the south.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My Dear 
Madam</span>,&mdash;Will you pardon me a great liberty, and allow
my little girl and me to come to see you to-day?&nbsp; I shall 
explain when we meet.&nbsp; When I say that we are Americans and 
have come seven thousand miles for the purpose, you will, I am 
sure, understand that it is no common interest which has brought 
us, and it will be the excuse for our eagerness.&nbsp; I should 
write you more fully, but as the matter is a confidential one I 
thought it would be better to speak.&nbsp; We shall be doubly 
grateful if you will have the kindness to see us alone.&nbsp; I 
write as a mother in making this appeal to your kindness; for my 
child&mdash;she is only a little over eight years old&mdash;has 
the matter so deeply in her heart that any disappointment or 
undue delay would I fear affect her health.&nbsp; We presume to 
take your kindness for granted and will call a little before 
twelve o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I may perhaps say (in case you should feel any 
hesitation as to my <i>bona fides</i>) that my husband purchased 
some years ago this estate.&nbsp; We were to have come here to 
live in the early summer, but were kept in the West by some 
important business of his.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&lsquo;Believe me, yours 
sincerely,<br />
&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Alice Stonehouse</span>.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stephen had, of course, no hesitation as to receiving the 
lady.&nbsp; Even had there been objection, the curiosity she had 
in common with her kind would have swept difficulties 
aside.&nbsp; She gave orders that when Mrs. Stonehouse arrived 
with her daughter they were to be shown at once into the Mandarin
drawing-room.&nbsp; That they would probably stay for 
lunch.&nbsp; She would see them alone.</p>
<p>A little before twelve o&rsquo;clock Mrs. Stonehouse and Pearl
arrived, and were shown into the room where Lady de Lannoy 
awaited them.&nbsp; The high sun, streaming in from the side, 
shone on her beautiful hair, making it look like living 
gold.&nbsp; When the Americans came in they were for an instant 
entranced by her beauty.&nbsp; One glance at Mrs. 
Stonehouse&rsquo;s sweet sympathetic face was enough to establish
her in Stephen&rsquo;s good graces forever.&nbsp; As for Pearl, 
she was like one who has unexpectedly seen a fairy or a 
goddess.&nbsp; She had been keeping guardedly behind her mother, 
but on the instant she came out fearlessly into the open.</p>
<p>Stephen advanced quickly and shook hands with Mrs. Stonehouse,
saying heartily:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am so glad you have come.&nbsp; I am honoured in 
being trusted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you so much, Lady de Lannoy.&nbsp; I felt that 
you would not mind, especially when you know why we came.&nbsp; 
Indeed I had no choice.&nbsp; Pearl insisted on it; and when 
Pearl is urgent&mdash;we who love her have all to give way.&nbsp;
This is Pearl!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In an instant Stephen was on her knees by the beautiful 
child.</p>
<p>The red rosebud of a mouth was raised to her kiss, and the 
little arms went lovingly round her neck and clung to her.&nbsp; 
As the mother looked on delighted she thought she had never seen 
a more beautiful sight.&nbsp; The two faces so different, and yet
with so much in common.&nbsp; The red hair and the flaxen, both 
tints of gold.&nbsp; The fine colour of each heightened to a 
bright flush in their eagerness.&nbsp; Stephen was so little used
to children, and yet loved them so, that all the womanhood in 
her, which is possible motherhood, went out in an instant to the 
lovely eager child.&nbsp; She felt the keenest pleasure when the 
little thing, having rubbed her silk-gloved palms over her face, 
and then holding her away so that she could see her many 
beauties, whispered in her ear:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How pretty you are!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You darling!&rsquo; whispered Stephen in reply.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;We must love each other very much, you and I!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the two ladies had sat down, Stephen holding Pearl in her
lap, Mrs. Stonehouse said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose you have wondered, Lady de Lannoy, what has 
brought us here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed I was very much interested.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I had better tell you all from the beginning so 
that you may understand.&rsquo;&nbsp; She proceeded to give the 
details of the meeting with Mr. Robinson on the 
<i>Scoriac</i>.&nbsp; Of how Pearl took to him and insisted on 
making him her special friend; of the terrible incident of her 
being swept overboard, and of the gallant rescue.&nbsp; Mrs. 
Stonehouse was much moved as she spoke.&nbsp; All that fearful 
time, of which the minutes had seemed years of agony, came back 
to her so vividly at times that she could hardly speak.&nbsp; 
Pearl listened too; all eagerness, but without fear.&nbsp; 
Stephen was greatly moved and held Pearl close to her all the 
time, as though protecting her.&nbsp; When the mother spoke of 
her feeling when she saw the brave man struggling up and down the
giant waves, and now and again losing sight of him in the trough 
of the sea, she put out one hand and held the mother&rsquo;s with
a grasp which vibrated in sympathy, whilst the great tears welled
over in her eyes and ran down her cheeks.&nbsp; Pearl, watching 
her keenly, said nothing, but taking her tiny cambric 
handkerchief from her pocket silently wiped the tears away, and 
clung all the tighter.&nbsp; It was her turn to protect now!</p>
<p>Pearl&rsquo;s own time for tears came when her mother began to
tell this new and sympathetic friend of how she became so much 
attached to her rescuer that when she knew he would not be coming
to the West with them, but going off to the wildest region of the
far North, her health became impaired; and that it was only when 
Mr. Robinson promised to come back to see her within three years 
that she was at all comforted.&nbsp; And how, ever since, she had
held the man in her heart and thought of him every day; sleeping 
as well as waking, for he was a factor in her dreams!</p>
<p>Stephen was more than ever moved, for the child&rsquo;s 
constancy touched her as well as her grief.&nbsp; She strained 
the little thing in her strong young arms, as though the fervency
of her grasp would bring belief and comfort; as it did.&nbsp; She
in her turn dried the others&rsquo; eyes.&nbsp; Then Mrs. 
Stonehouse went on with her story:</p>
<p>&lsquo;We were at Banff, high up in the Rockies, when we read 
of the burning and wrecking of the <i>Dominion</i>.&nbsp; It is, 
as you know, a Montreal boat of the Allan Line; so that naturally
there was a full telegraphic report in all the Canadian 
papers.&nbsp; When we read of the brave man who swam ashore with 
the line and who was unable to reach the port but swam out across
the bay, Pearl took it for granted that it must have been 
&ldquo;The Man,&rdquo; as she always called Mr. Robinson.&nbsp; 
When by the next paper we learned that the man&rsquo;s name 
<i>was</i> Robinson nothing would convince her that it was not 
<i>her</i> Mr. Robinson.&nbsp; My husband, I may tell you, had 
firmly come to the same conclusion.&nbsp; He had ever since the 
rescue of our child always looked for any news from Alaska, 
whither he knew Mr. Robinson had gone.&nbsp; He learned that up 
away in the very far North a new goldfield had been discovered by
a man of the same name; and that a new town, Robinson City, began
to grow up in the wilderness, where the condition of life from 
the cold was a new experience to even the most hardy gold 
miners.&nbsp; Then we began to think that the young hero who had 
so gallantly saved our darling was meeting some of his reward . .
. !&rsquo;</p>
<p>She paused, her voice breaking.&nbsp; Stephen was in a glow of
holy feeling.&nbsp; Gladness, joy, gratitude, enthusiasm; she 
knew not which.&nbsp; It all seemed like a noble dream which was 
coming true.&nbsp; Mrs. Stonehouse went on:-</p>
<p>&lsquo;From Californian papers of last month we learned that 
Robinson, of Robinson City, had sailed for San Francisco, but had
disappeared when the ship touched at Portland; and then the whole
chain of his identity seemed complete.&nbsp; Nothing would 
satisfy Pearl but that we should come at once to England and see 
&ldquo;The Man,&rdquo; who was wounded and blind, and do what we 
could for him.&nbsp; Her father could not then come himself; he 
had important work on hand which he could not leave without some 
preparation.&nbsp; But he is following us and may be here at any 
time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, we want you to help us, Lady de Lannoy.&nbsp; 
We are not sure yet of the identity of Mr. Robinson, but we shall
know the instant we see him, or hear his voice.&nbsp; We have 
learned that he is still here.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you let 
us?&nbsp; Do let us see him as soon as ever you can!&rsquo;&nbsp;
There was a pleading tone in her voice which alone would have 
moved Stephen, even had she not been wrought up already by the 
glowing fervour of her new friend.</p>
<p>But she paused.&nbsp; She did not know what to say; how to 
tell them that as yet she herself knew nothing.&nbsp; She, too, 
in the depths of her own heart knew&mdash;<i>knew</i>&mdash;that 
it was the same Robinson.&nbsp; And she also knew that both 
identities were one with another.&nbsp; The beating of her heart 
and the wild surging of her blood told her all.&nbsp; She was 
afraid to speak lest her voice should betray her.</p>
<p>She could not even think.&nbsp; She would have to be alone for
that.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stonehouse, with the wisdom and power of age, waited, 
suspending judgment.&nbsp; But Pearl was in a fever of anxiety; 
she could imagine nothing which could keep her away from The 
Man.&nbsp; But she saw that there was some difficulty, some cause
of delay.&nbsp; So she too added her pleading.&nbsp; Putting her 
mouth close to Lady de Lannoy&rsquo;s ear she whispered very 
faintly, very caressingly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is your name?&nbsp; Your own name?&nbsp; Your very
own name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stephen, my darling!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t you let us see The Man, Stephen; dear 
Stephen!&nbsp; I love him so; and I do <i>so</i> want to see 
him.&nbsp; It is ages till I see him!&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you let 
me?&nbsp; I shall be so good&mdash;Stephen!&rsquo;&nbsp; And she 
strained her closer in her little arms and kissed her all over 
face, cheeks and forehead and eyes and mouth wooingly.&nbsp; 
Stephen returned the embrace and the kisses, but remained silent 
a little longer.&nbsp; Then she found voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hardly know what to say.&nbsp; Believe me, I 
should&mdash;I shall, do all I can; but the fact is that I am not
in authority.&nbsp; The Doctor has taken him in charge and will 
not let anyone go near him: He will not even have a nurse, but 
watches and attends to him himself.&nbsp; He says it might be 
fatal if anything should occur to agitate him.&nbsp; Why, even I 
am not allowed to see him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen him yet at all; ever, ever, 
Stephen?&rsquo; asked Pearl, all her timidity gone.&nbsp; Stephen
smiled&mdash;a wan smile it was, as she answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I saw him in the water, but it was too far away to 
distinguish.&nbsp; And it was only by firelight.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, I know,&rsquo; said Pearl; &lsquo;Mother and 
Daddy told me how you had burned the house down to give him 
light.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you want to see him more after 
that?&nbsp; I should!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen drew the impulsive 
child closer as she answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed I did, dear.&nbsp; But I had to think of what 
was good for him.&nbsp; I went to his room the next day when he 
was awake, and the Doctor let me come in for only a 
moment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well!&nbsp; What did you see.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you 
know him?&rsquo;&nbsp; She forgot that the other did not know him
from her point of view.&nbsp; But the question went through 
Stephen&rsquo;s heart like a sword.&nbsp; What would she not have
given to have known him!&nbsp; What would she not give to know 
him now! . . . She spoke mechanically:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The room was quite dark.&nbsp; It is necessary, the 
Doctor says, that he be kept in the dark.&nbsp; I saw only a big 
beard, partly burned away by the fire; and a great bandage which 
covered his eyes!&rsquo;&nbsp; Pearl&rsquo;s hold relaxed, she 
slipped like an eel to the floor and ran over to her 
mother.&nbsp; Her new friend was all very well, but no one would 
do as well as mother when she was in trouble.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh mother, mother!&nbsp; My Robinson had no 
beard!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her mother stroked her face comfortingly as 
she answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear, it is more than two years since you saw 
him.&nbsp; Two years and three months, for it was in June that we
crossed.&rsquo;&nbsp; How the date thrilled Stephen.&nbsp; It 
verified her assumption.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stonehouse did not notice, but went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;His beard would have grown.&nbsp; Men wear beards up in
the cold place where he was.&rsquo;&nbsp; Pearl kissed her; there
was no need for words.&nbsp; Throwing herself again on 
Stephen&rsquo;s knees she went on with her questioning:</p>
<p>&lsquo;But didn&rsquo;t you hear him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I heard very little, darling.&nbsp; He was very 
weak.&nbsp; It was only the morning after the wreck, and he spoke
in a whisper!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then with an instinct of 
self-preservation she added: &lsquo;But how could I learn 
anything by hearing him when he was a stranger to me?&nbsp; I had
never even heard of Mr. Robinson!&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she was speaking she found her own ideas, the proofs of her
own conviction growing.&nbsp; This was surely another link in the
chain of proving that all three men were but one.&nbsp; But in 
such case Harold must know; must have tried to hide his 
identity!</p>
<p>She feared, with keen eyes upon her, to pursue the 
thought.&nbsp; But her blood began to grow cold and her brain to 
swim.&nbsp; With an effort she went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Even since then I have not been allowed to go near 
him.&nbsp; Of course I must obey orders.&nbsp; I am waiting as 
patiently as I can.&nbsp; But we must ask the Doctor if he thinks
his patient will see you&mdash;will let you see him&mdash;though 
he will not let me.&rsquo;&nbsp; This she added with a touch of 
what she felt: regret rather than bitter ness.&nbsp; There was no
room for bitterness in her full heart where Harold was 
concerned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you ask the Doctor now?&rsquo;&nbsp; Pearl did not
let grass grow under her feet.&nbsp; For answer Stephen rang the 
bell, and when a servant appeared asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is Mr. Hilton in the house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think not, your Ladyship.&nbsp; He said he was going 
over to Port Lannoch.&nbsp; Shall I inquire if he left word at 
what time he would be back?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you please!&rsquo;&nbsp; The man returned in a few 
minutes with the butler, who said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Hilton said, your Ladyship, that he expected to be 
back by one o&rsquo;clock at latest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please ask him on his arrival if he will kindly come 
here at once.&nbsp; Do not let us be disturbed until 
then.&rsquo;&nbsp; The butler bowed and withdrew.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Stephen, &lsquo;as we have to wait 
till our tyrant comes, won&rsquo;t you tell me all that went on 
after The Man had left you?&rsquo;&nbsp; Pearl brightened up at 
once.&nbsp; Stephen would have given anything to get away even 
for a while.&nbsp; Beliefs and hopes and fears were surging up, 
till she felt choking.&nbsp; But the habit of her life, 
especially her life of the last two years, gave her 
self-control.&nbsp; And so she waited, trying with all her might 
to follow the child&rsquo;s prattle.</p>
<p>After a long wait Pearl exclaimed: &lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; I do wish 
that Doctor would come.&nbsp; I want to see The Man!&rsquo;&nbsp;
She was so restless, marching about the room, that Stephen 
said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you like to go out on the balcony, darling; of 
course if Mother will let you?&nbsp; It is quite safe, I assure 
you, Mrs. Stonehouse.&nbsp; It is wide and open and is just above
the flower-borders, with a stone tail.&nbsp; You can see the road
from it by which Mr. Hilton comes from Port Lannoch.&nbsp; He 
will be riding.&rsquo;&nbsp; Pearl yielded at once to the 
diversion.&nbsp; It would at any rate be something to do, to 
watch.&nbsp; Stephen opened the French window and the child ran 
out on the balcony.</p>
<p>When Stephen came back to her seat Mrs. Stonehouse said 
quietly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad she is away for a few minutes.&nbsp; She has 
been over wrought, and I am always afraid for her.&nbsp; She is 
so sensitive.&nbsp; And after all she is only a baby!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is a darling!&rsquo; said Stephen impulsively; and 
she meant it.&nbsp; Mrs. Stonehouse smiled gratefully as she went
on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose you noticed what a hold on her imagination 
that episode of Mollie Watford at the bank had.&nbsp; Mr. 
Stonehouse is, as perhaps you know, a very rich man.&nbsp; He has
made his fortune himself, and most honourably; and we are all 
very proud of him, and of it.&nbsp; So Pearl does not think of 
the money for itself.&nbsp; But the feeling was everything; she 
really loves Mr. Robinson; as indeed she ought!&nbsp; He has done
so much for us that it would be a pride and a privilege for us to
show our gratitude.&nbsp; My husband, between ourselves, wanted 
to make him his partner.&nbsp; He tells me that, quite 
independent of our feeling towards him, he is just the man he 
wanted.&nbsp; And if indeed it was he who discovered the Alaskan 
goldfield and organised and ruled Robinson City, it is a proof 
that Mr. Stonehouse&rsquo;s judgment was sound.&nbsp; Now he is 
injured, and blind; and our little Pearl loves him.&nbsp; If 
indeed he be the man we believe he is, then we may be able to do 
something which all his millions cannot buy.&nbsp; He will come 
to us, and be as a son to us, and a brother to Pearl.&nbsp; We 
will be his eyes; and nothing but love and patience will guide 
his footsteps!&rsquo;&nbsp; She paused, her mouth quivering; then
she went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;If it is not our Mr. Robinson, then it will be our 
pleasure to do all that is necessary for his comfort.&nbsp; If he
is a poor man he will never want . . . It will be a privilege to 
save so gallant a man from hardship . . . &rsquo;&nbsp; Here she 
came to a stop.</p>
<p>Stephen too was glad of the pause, for the emotion which the 
words and their remembrances evoked was choking her.&nbsp; Had 
not Harold been as her own father&rsquo;s son.&nbsp; As her own 
brother! . . . She turned away, fearing lest her face should 
betray her.</p>
<p>All at once Mrs. Stonehouse started to her feet, her face 
suddenly white with fear; for a cry had come to their ears.&nbsp;
A cry which even Stephen knew as Pearl&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The mother 
ran to the window.</p>
<p>The balcony was empty.&nbsp; She came back into the room, and,
ran to the door.</p>
<p>But on the instant a voice that both women knew was heard from
without:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Help there!&nbsp; Help, I say!&nbsp; The child has 
fainted.&nbsp; Is there no one there?&nbsp; And I am 
blind!&rsquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI&mdash;LIGHT</h2>
<p>Harold had been in a state of increasing restlessness.&nbsp; 
The month of waiting which Dr. Hilton had laid down for him 
seemed to wear away with extraordinary slowness; this was 
increased by the lack of companionship, and further by the 
cutting off of even the little episodes usual to daily 
life.&nbsp; His patience, great as it was naturally and trained 
as it had been by the years of self-repression, was beginning to 
give way.&nbsp; Often and often there came over him a wild desire
to tear off the irksome bandages and try for himself whether the 
hopes held out to him were being even partially justified.&nbsp; 
He was restrained only by the fear of perpetual blindness, which 
came over him in a sort of cold wave at each reaction.&nbsp; 
Time, too, added to his fear of discovery; but he could not but 
think that his self-sought isolation must be a challenge to the 
curiosity of each and all who knew of it.&nbsp; And with all 
these disturbing causes came the main one, which never lessened 
but always grew: that whatever might happen Stephen would be 
further from him than ever.&nbsp; Look at the matter how he 
would; turn it round in whatsoever possible or impossible way, he
could see no relief to this gloomy conclusion.</p>
<p>For it is in the nature of love that it creates or enlarges 
its own pain.&nbsp; If troubles or difficulties there be from 
natural causes, then it will exaggerate them into nightmare 
proportions.&nbsp; But if there be none, it will create 
them.&nbsp; Love is in fact the most serious thing that comes to 
man; where it exists all else seem as phantoms, or at best as 
actualities of lesser degree.&nbsp; During the better part of two
years his troubles had but slept; and as nothing wakes the pangs 
of old love better than the sound of a voice, all the old acute 
pain of love and the agony that followed its denial were back 
with him.&nbsp; Surely he could never, never believe that Stephen
did not mean what she had said to him that morning in the beech 
grove.&nbsp; All his new resolution not to hamper her with the 
burden of a blind and lonely-hearted man was back to the 
full.</p>
<p>In such mood had he been that morning.&nbsp; He was 
additionally disturbed because the Doctor had gone early to Port 
Lannoch; and as he was the only person with whom he could talk, 
he clung to him with something of the helpless feeling of a 
frightened child to its nurse.</p>
<p>The day being full of sunshine the window was open, and only 
the dark-green blind which crackled and rustled with every 
passing breeze made the darkness of the room.&nbsp; Harold was 
dressed and lay on a sofa placed back in the room, where the few 
rays of light thus entering could not reach him.&nbsp; His eyes 
and forehead were bandaged as ever.&nbsp; For some days the 
Doctor, who had his own reasons and his own purpose, had not 
taken them off; so the feeling of blind helplessness was doubly 
upon him.&nbsp; He knew he was blind; and he knew also that if he
were not he could not in his present condition see.</p>
<p>All at once he started up awake.&nbsp; His hearing had in the 
weeks of darkness grown abnormally acute, and some trifling sound
had recalled him to himself.&nbsp; It might have been 
inspiration, but he seemed to be conscious of some presence in 
the room.</p>
<p>As he rose from the sofa, with the violent motion of a strong 
man startled into unconscious activity, he sent a shock of fear 
to the eager child who had strayed into the room through the open
window.&nbsp; Had he presented a normal appearance, she would not
have been frightened.&nbsp; She would have recognised his 
identity despite the changes, and have sprung to him so 
impulsively that she would have been in his arms before she had 
time to think.&nbsp; But now all she saw was a great beard topped
with a mass of linen and lint, which obscured all the rest of the
face and seemed in the gloom like a gigantic and ominous 
turban.</p>
<p>In her fright she screamed out.&nbsp; He in turn, forgetful 
for the moment of his intention of silence, called aloud:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who is that?&rsquo;&nbsp; Pearl, who had been 
instinctively backing towards the window by which she had 
entered, and whose thoughts in her fright had gone back to her 
mother&mdash;refuge in time of danger&mdash;cried out:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mother, Mother!&nbsp; It is him!&nbsp; It is The 
Man!&rsquo;&nbsp; She would have run towards him in spite of his 
forbidding appearance; but the shock had been too much for 
her.&nbsp; The little knees trembled and gave way; the brain 
reeled; and with a moan she sank on the floor in a swoon.</p>
<p>Harold knew the voice the instant she spoke; there was no need
for the enlightening words</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pearl!&nbsp; Pearl!&rsquo; he cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come 
to me, darling!&rsquo;&nbsp; But as he spoke he heard her moan, 
and the soft thud of her little body on the thick carpet.&nbsp; 
He guessed the truth and groped his way towards where the sound 
had been, for he feared lest he might trample upon her in too 
great eagerness.&nbsp; Kneeling by her he touched her little 
feet, and then felt his way to her face.&nbsp; And as he did so, 
such is the double action of the mind, even in the midst of his 
care the remembrance swept across his mind of how he had once 
knelt in just such manner in an old church by another little 
senseless form.&nbsp; In his confusion of mind he lost the 
direction of the door, and coming to the window pushed forward 
the flapping blind and went out on the balcony.&nbsp; He knew 
from the freshness of the air and the distant sounds that he was 
in the open.&nbsp; This disturbed him, as he wished to find 
someone who could attend to the fainting child.&nbsp; But as he 
had lost the way back to the room now, he groped along the wall 
of the Castle with one hand, whilst he held Pearl securely in the
other.&nbsp; As he went he called out for help.</p>
<p>When he came opposite the window of the Mandarin room Mrs. 
Stonehouse saw him; she ran to him and caught Pearl in her 
arms.&nbsp; She was so agitated, so lost in concern for the child
that she never even thought to speak to the man whom she had come
so far to seek.&nbsp; She wailed over the child:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pearl!&nbsp; Pearl!&nbsp; What is it, darling?&nbsp; It
is Mother!&rsquo;&nbsp; She laid the girl on the sofa, and taking
the flowers out of a glass began to sprinkle water on the 
child&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Harold knew her voice and waited in 
patience.&nbsp; Presently the child sighed; the mother, relieved,
thought of other things at last and looked around her.</p>
<p>There was yet another trouble.&nbsp; There on the floor, where
she had slipped down, lay Lady de Lannoy in a swoon.&nbsp; She 
called out instinctively, forgetting for the moment that the man 
was blind, but feeling all the old confidence which he had won in
her heart:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Robinson, help me!&nbsp; Lady de Lannoy 
has fainted too, and I do not know what to do!&rsquo;&nbsp; As 
she spoke she looked up at him and remembered his 
blindness.&nbsp; But she had no time to alter her words; the 
instant she had spoken Harold, who had been leaning against the 
window-sash, and whose mind was calmer since with his acute 
hearing he too had heard Pearl sigh, seemed to leap into the 
room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is she?&nbsp; Where is she?&nbsp; Oh, God, now am
I blind indeed!&rsquo;</p>
<p>It gave her a pang to hear him and to see him turn helplessly 
with his arms and hands outstretched as though he would feel for 
her in the air.</p>
<p>Without pause, and under an instinctive and uncontrollable 
impulse, he tore the bandages from his eyes.&nbsp; The sun was 
streaming in.&nbsp; As he met it his eyes blinked and a cry burst
from him; a wild cry whose joy and surprise pierced even through 
the shut portals of the swooning woman&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp; Not 
for worlds would she ever after have lost the memory of that 
sound:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Light! light!&nbsp; Oh, God!&nbsp; Oh, God!&nbsp; I am 
not blind!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But he looked round him still in terrified wonder:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where is she?&nbsp; Where is she?&nbsp; I cannot see 
her!&nbsp; Stephen!&nbsp; Stephen! where are you?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Mrs. Stonehouse, bewildered, pointed where Stephen&rsquo;s 
snow-white face and brilliant hair seemed in the streaming 
sunlight like ivory and gold:</p>
<p>&lsquo;There!&nbsp; There!&rsquo;&nbsp; He caught her arm 
mechanically, and putting his eyes to her wrist, tried to look 
along her pointed finger.&nbsp; In an instant he dropped her arm 
moaning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot see her!&nbsp; What is it that is over 
me?&nbsp; This is worse than to be blind!&rsquo;&nbsp; He covered
his face with his hands and sobbed.</p>
<p>He felt light strong fingers on his forehead and hands; 
fingers whose touch he would have known had they been laid on him
were he no longer quick.&nbsp; A voice whose music he had heard 
in his dreams for two long years said softly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am here, Harold!&nbsp; I am here!&nbsp; Oh! do not 
sob like that; it breaks my heart to hear you!&rsquo;&nbsp; He 
took his hands from his face and held hers in them, staring 
intently at her as though his passionate gaze would win through 
every obstacle.</p>
<p>That moment he never forgot.&nbsp; Never could forget!&nbsp; 
He saw the room all rich in yellow.&nbsp; He saw Pearl, pale but 
glad-eyed, lying on a sofa holding the hand of her mother, who 
stood beside her.&nbsp; He saw the great high window open, the 
lines of the covered stone balcony without, the stretch of green 
sward all vivid in the sunshine, and beyond it the blue quivering
sea.&nbsp; He saw all but that for which his very soul longed; 
without to see which sight itself was valueless . . . But still 
he looked, and looked; and Stephen saw in his dark eyes, though 
he could not see her, that which made her own eyes fill and the 
warm red glow on her face again . . . Then she raised her eyes 
again, and the gladness of her beating heart seemed the answer to
his own.</p>
<p>For as he looked he saw, as though emerging from a mist whose 
obscurity melted with each instant, what was to him the one face 
in all the world.&nbsp; He did not think then of its 
beauty&mdash;that would come later; and besides no beauty of one 
born of woman could outmatch the memorised beauty which had so 
long held his heart.&nbsp; But that he had so schooled himself in
long months of gloomy despair, he would have taken her in his 
arms there and then; and, heedless of the presence of others, 
have poured out his full heart to her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stonehouse saw and understood.&nbsp; So too Pearl, who 
though a child was a woman-child; softly they rose up to steal 
away.&nbsp; But Stephen saw them; her own instincts, too, told 
her that her hour had not come.&nbsp; What she hoped for must 
come alone!&nbsp; So she called to her guests:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t go!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t go, Mrs. 
Stonehouse.&nbsp; You know now that Harold and I are old friends,
though neither of us knew it&mdash;till this moment.&nbsp; We 
were brought up as . . . almost as brother and sister.&nbsp; 
Pearl, isn&rsquo;t it lovely to see your friend . . . to see The 
Man again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was so happy that she could only express herself, with 
dignity, through the happiness of others.</p>
<p>Pearl actually shrieked with joy as she rushed across the room
and flung herself into Harold&rsquo;s arms as he stooped to 
her.&nbsp; He raised her; and she kissed him again and again, and
put her little hands all over his face and stroked, very, very 
gently, his eyes, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I am so glad!&nbsp; And so glad your poor eyes are 
unbind again!&nbsp; May I call you Harold, too?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You darling!&rsquo; was all he could say as he kissed 
her, and holding her in one arm went across and shook hands with 
Mrs. Stonehouse, who wrung his hand hard.</p>
<p>There was a little awkwardness in the group, for none of them 
knew what would be best to do next.&nbsp; In the midst of it 
there came a light knock at the door, and Mr. Hilton entered 
saying:</p>
<p>&lsquo;They told me you wished to see me at 
once&mdash;Hulloa!&rsquo;&nbsp; He rushed across the room and 
took Harold by the shoulders, turning his face to the 
light.&nbsp; He looked in his eyes long and earnestly, the others
holding their breaths.&nbsp; Presently he said, without relaxing 
his gaze:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did you see mistily at first?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seeing at the periphery; but the centre being 
opaque?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes!&nbsp; How did you know?&nbsp; Why, I 
couldn&rsquo;t see&rsquo;&mdash;see pointing to 
Stephen&mdash;&lsquo;Lady de Lannoy; though her face was right in
front of me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Hilton took his hands from his patient&rsquo;s shoulders 
and shook him warmly by both hands:-</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am glad, old fellow!&nbsp; It was worth waiting for, 
wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; But I say, it was a dangerous thing to 
take off those bandages before I permitted.&nbsp; However, it has
done no harm!&nbsp; But it was lucky that I mistrusted your 
patience and put the time for the experiment a week later than I 
thought necessary . . . What is it?&rsquo;&nbsp; He turned from 
one to the other questioningly; there was a look on 
Harold&rsquo;s face that he did not quite comprehend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;H-s-h,&rsquo; said the latter warningly, 
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it . . . some 
time!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The awkward pause was broken by Pearl, who came to the Doctor 
and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must kiss you, you know.&nbsp; It was you who saved 
The Man&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; Stephen has told me how you watched 
him!&rsquo;&nbsp; The Doctor was somewhat taken aback; as yet he 
was ignorant of Pearl&rsquo;s existence.&nbsp; However, he raised
the child in his arms and kissed her, saying:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you, my dear!&nbsp; I did all I could.&nbsp; But 
he helped much himself; except at the very last.&nbsp; 
Don&rsquo;t you ever go and take off bandages, if you should ever
have the misfortune to have them on, without the doctor&rsquo;s 
permission!&rsquo;&nbsp; Pearl nodded her head wisely and then 
wriggled out of his arms and came again to Harold, looking up at 
him protectingly and saying in an old-fashioned way:</p>
<p>&lsquo;How are you feeling now?&nbsp; None the worse, I hope, 
<i>Harold</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Man lifted her up and kissed her again.&nbsp; When he set 
her down she came over to Lady de Lannoy and held up her arms to 
be lifted:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And I must kiss you again too, Stephen!&rsquo;&nbsp; If
Lady de Lannoy hadn&rsquo;t loved the sweet little thing already 
she would have loved her for that!</p>
<p>The door was opened, and the butler announced:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Luncheon is served, your Ladyship.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>After a few days Harold went over to Varilands to stay for a 
while with the Stonehouses.&nbsp; Mr. Stonehouse had arrived, and
both men were rejoiced to meet again.&nbsp; The elder never 
betrayed by word or sign that he recognised the identity of the 
other person of the drama of whom he had told him and who had 
come so accidentally into his life; and the younger was grateful 
to him for it.&nbsp; Harold went almost every day to Lannoy, and 
sometimes the Stonehouses went with him; at other times Stephen 
paid flying visits to Varilands.&nbsp; She did not make any 
effort to detain Harold; she would not for worlds have made a 
sign which might influence him.&nbsp; She was full now of that 
diffidence which every woman has who loves.&nbsp; She felt that 
she must wait; must wait even if the waiting lasted to her 
grave.&nbsp; She felt, as every woman does who really loves, that
she had found her Master.</p>
<p>And Harold, to whom something of the same diffidence was an 
old story, got the idea that her reticence was a part of the same
feeling whose violent expression had sent him out into the 
wilderness.&nbsp; And with the thought came the idea of his duty,
implied in her father&rsquo;s dying trust: &lsquo;Give her time! 
. . . Let her choose!&rsquo;&nbsp; For him the clock seemed to 
have stopped for two whole years, and he was back at the time 
when the guardianship of his boy life was beginning to yield to 
the larger and more selfish guardianship of manhood.</p>
<p>Stephen, noticing that he did not come near her as closely as 
she felt he might, and not realising his true reason&mdash;for 
when did love ever realise the true reason of the bashfulness of 
love?&mdash;felt a chillness which in turn reacted on her own 
manner.</p>
<p>And so these two ardent souls, who yearned for each 
other&rsquo;s love and the full expression of it, seemed as if 
they might end after all in drifting apart.&nbsp; Each thought 
that their secret was concealed.&nbsp; But both secrets were 
already known to Mrs. Stonehouse, who knew nothing; and to Mr. 
Stonehouse, who knew everything.&nbsp; Even Pearl had her own 
ideas, as was once shown in a confidence when they were alone in 
Stephen&rsquo;s bedroom after helping her to finish her dressing,
just as Stephen herself had at a similar age helped her Uncle 
Gilbert.&nbsp; After some coy leading up to the subject of pretty
dresses, the child putting her little mouth to the other&rsquo;s 
ear whispered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;May I be your bridesmaid, Stephen?&rsquo;&nbsp; The 
woman was taken aback; but she had to speak at once, for the 
child&rsquo;s eyes were on her:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course you will, darling.&nbsp; But I&mdash;I may 
never be married.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You!&nbsp; You must!&nbsp; I know someone who will make
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s heart beat hard and 
rapidly.&nbsp; The child&rsquo;s talk, though sweet and dear, was
more than embarrassing.&nbsp; With, however, the desire to play 
with fire, which is a part of the nature of women, she 
answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have some queer ideas, little one, in that pretty 
knowledge-box of yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh! he never told me.&nbsp; But I know it all the 
same!&nbsp; And you know it too, Stephen!&rsquo;&nbsp; This was 
getting too close to be without danger; so she tried to divert 
the thought from herself:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My darling, you may guess about other people, though I 
don&rsquo;t say you ought; but you must not guess about 
me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; then she held up her arms to be 
lifted on the other&rsquo;s knee and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I want to whisper to you!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her voice and 
manner were so full of feeling that somehow the other was 
moved.&nbsp; She bent her head, and Pearl taking her neck in her 
little palms, said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I thought, oh! long ago, that I would marry him 
myself.&nbsp; But you knew him first . . . And he only saved me .
. . But you saved him!&rsquo; . . . And then she laid her head 
down on the throbbing bosom, and sobbed . . .</p>
<p>And Stephen sobbed too.</p>
<p>Before they left the room, Stephen said to her, very gravely, 
for the issue might be one of great concern:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course, Pearl dear, our secrets are all between 
ourselves!&rsquo;&nbsp; Pearl crossed her two forefingers and 
kissed them.&nbsp; But she said nothing; she had sworn!&nbsp; 
Stephen went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, darling, you will remember too that one must never
speak or even think if they can help it about anyone&rsquo;s 
marrying anyone else till they say so themselves!&nbsp; What is 
it, dear, that you are smiling at?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know, Stephen!&nbsp; I musn&rsquo;t take off the 
bandage till the Doctor says so!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Stephen smiled and kissed her.&nbsp; Hand in hand, Pearl 
chattering merrily, they went down to the drawing-room.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII&mdash;GOLDEN SILENCE</h2>
<p>Each day that passed seemed to add to the trouble in the heart
of these young people; to widen the difficulty of expressing 
themselves.&nbsp; To Stephen, who had accepted the new condition 
of things and whose whole nature had bloomed again under the 
sunshine of hope, it was the less intolerable.&nbsp; She had set 
herself to wait, as had countless thousands of women before her; 
and as due proportion will, till the final cataclysm abolishes 
earthly unions.&nbsp; But Harold felt the growth, both positive 
and negative, as a new torture; and he began to feel that he 
would be unable to go through with it.&nbsp; In his heart was the
constant struggle of hope; and in opposition to it the seeming 
realisation of every new fancy of evil.&nbsp; That bitter hour, 
when the whole of creation was for him turned upside down, was 
having its sad effect at last.&nbsp; Had it not been for that 
horrid remembrance he would have come to believe enough in 
himself to put his future to the test.&nbsp; He would have made 
an opportunity at which Stephen and himself would have with the 
fires of their mutual love burned away the encircling mist.&nbsp;
There are times when a single minute of commonsense would turn 
sorrow into joy; and yet that minute, our own natures being the 
opposing forces, will be allowed to pass.</p>
<p>Those who loved these young people were much concerned about 
them.&nbsp; Mrs. Stonehouse took their trouble so much to heart 
that she spoke to her husband about it, seriously advising that 
one or other of them should make an effort to bring things in the
right way for their happiness.&nbsp; The woman was sure of the 
woman&rsquo;s feeling.&nbsp; It is from men, not women, that 
women hide their love.&nbsp; By side-glances and unthinking 
moments women note and learn.&nbsp; The man knew already, from 
his own lips, of the man&rsquo;s passion.&nbsp; But his lips were
sealed by his loyalty; and he said earnestly:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, we must not interfere.&nbsp; Not now, at any 
rate; we might cause them great trouble.&nbsp; I am as sure as 
you are that they really love each other.&nbsp; But they must win
happiness by themselves and through themselves alone.&nbsp; 
Otherwise it would never be to them what it ought to be; what it 
might be; what it will be!&rsquo;</p>
<p>So these friends were silent, and the little tragedy 
developed.&nbsp; Harold&rsquo;s patience began to give way under 
the constant strain of self-suppression.&nbsp; Stephen tried to 
hide her love and fear, under the mask of a gracious calm.&nbsp; 
This the other took for indifference.</p>
<p>At last there came an hour which was full of new, hopeless 
agony to Stephen.&nbsp; She heard Harold, in a fragment of 
conversation, speak to Mr. Stonehouse of the need of returning to
Alaska.&nbsp; That sounded like a word of doom.&nbsp; In her 
inmost heart she knew that Harold loved her; and had she been 
free she would have herself spoken the words which would have 
drawn the full truth to them both.&nbsp; But how could she do so,
having the remembrance of that other episode; when, without the 
reality of love, she had declared herself? . . . Oh! the shame of
it . . . The folly! . . . And Harold knew it all!&nbsp; How could
he ever believe that it was real this time! . . .</p>
<p>By the exercise of that self-restraint which long suffering 
had taught her, Stephen so managed to control herself that none 
of her guests realised what a blow she had received from a casual
word.&nbsp; She bore herself gallantly till the last 
moment.&nbsp; After the old fashion of her youth, she had from 
the Castle steps seen their departure.&nbsp; Then she took her 
way to her own room, and locked herself in.&nbsp; She did not 
often, in these days, give way to tears; when she did cry it was 
as a luxury, and not from poignant cause.&nbsp; Her deep emotion 
was dry-eyed as of old.&nbsp; Now, she did not cry, she sat 
still, her hands clasped below her knees, with set white face 
gazing out on the far-off sea.&nbsp; For hours she sat there 
lonely; staring fixedly all the time, though her thoughts were 
whirling wildly.&nbsp; At first she had some vague purpose, which
she hoped might eventually work out into a plan.&nbsp; But 
thought would not come.&nbsp; Everywhere there was the same 
beginning: a wild, burning desire to let Harold understand her 
feeling towards him; to blot out, with the conviction of trust 
and love, those bitter moments when in the madness of her 
overstrung passion she had heaped such insult upon him.&nbsp; 
Everywhere the same end: an impasse.&nbsp; He seemingly could 
not, would not, understand.&nbsp; She knew now that the man had 
diffidences, forbearances, self-judgments and self-denials which 
made for the suppression, in what he considered to be her 
interest, of his own desires.&nbsp; This was tragedy 
indeed!&nbsp; Again and again came back the remembrance of that 
bitter regret of her Aunt Laetitia, which no happiness and no 
pain of her own had ever been able to efface:</p>
<p>&lsquo;To love; and be helpless!&nbsp; To wait, and wait, and 
wait; with heart all aflame!&nbsp; To hope, and hope; till time 
seemed to have passed away, and all the world to stand still on 
your hopeless misery!&nbsp; To know that a word might open up 
Heaven; and yet to have to remain mute!&nbsp; To keep back the 
glances that could enlighten, to modulate the tones that might 
betray!&nbsp; To see all you hoped for passing away . . . 
!&rsquo;</p>
<p>At last she seemed to understand the true force of pride; 
which has in it a thousand forces of its own, positive, negative,
restrainful.&nbsp; Oh! how blind she had been!&nbsp; How little 
she had learned from the miseries that the other woman whom she 
loved had suffered!&nbsp; How unsympathetic she had been; how 
self-engrossed; how callous to the sensibilities of others!&nbsp;
And now to her, in her turn, had come the same suffering; the 
same galling of the iron fetters of pride, and of convention 
which is its original expression!&nbsp; Must it be that the very 
salt of youth must lose its savour, before the joys of youth 
could be won!&nbsp; What, after all, was youth if out of its own 
inherent power it must work its own destruction!&nbsp; If youth 
was so, why not then trust the wisdom of age?&nbsp; If youth 
could not act for its own redemption . . .</p>
<p>Here the rudiment of a thought struck her and changed the 
current of her reason.&nbsp; A thought so winged with hope that 
she dared not even try to complete it! . . . She thought, and 
thought till the long autumn shadows fell around her.&nbsp; But 
the misty purpose had become real.</p>
<p>After dinner she went up alone to the mill.&nbsp; It was late 
for a visit, for the Silver Lady kept early hours.&nbsp; But she 
found her friend as usual in her room, whose windows swept the 
course of the sun.&nbsp; Seeing that her visitor was in a state 
of mental disturbance such as she had once before exhibited, she 
blew out the candles and took the same seat in the eastern window
she had occupied on the night which they both so well 
remembered.</p>
<p>Stephen understood both acts, and was grateful afresh.&nbsp; 
The darkness would be a help to her in what she had to say; and 
the resumption of the old seat and attitude did away with the 
awkwardness of new confidence.&nbsp; During the weeks that had 
passed Stephen had kept her friend informed of the rescue and 
progress of the injured man.&nbsp; Since the discovery of 
Harold&rsquo;s identity she had allowed her to infer her feeling 
towards him.</p>
<p>Shyly she had conveyed her hopes that all the bitter part of 
the past might be wiped out.&nbsp; To the woman who already knew 
of the love that had always been, but had only awakened to 
consciousness in the absence of its object, a hint was sufficient
to build upon.&nbsp; She had noticed the gloom that had of late 
been creeping over the girl&rsquo;s happiness; and she had been 
much troubled about it.&nbsp; But she had thought it wiser to be 
silent; she well knew that should unhappily the time for comfort 
come, it must be precluded by new and more explicit 
confidence.&nbsp; So she too had been anxiously waiting the 
progress of events.&nbsp; Now; as she put her arms round the girl
she said softly; not in the whisper which implies doubt of some 
kind, but in the soft voices which conveys sympathy and 
trust:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me, dear child!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then in broken words shyly spoken, and spoken in such a 
way that the silences were more eloquent than the words, the girl
conveyed what was in her heart.&nbsp; The other listened, now and
again stroking the beautiful hair.&nbsp; When all was said, there
was a brief pause.&nbsp; The Silver Lady spoke no word; but the 
pressure of her delicate hand conveyed sympathy.</p>
<p>In but a half-conscious way, in words that came so shrinkingly
through the darkness that they hardly reached the ear bent low to
catch them, came Stephen&rsquo;s murmured thought:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, if he only knew!&nbsp; And I can&rsquo;t tell him; 
I can&rsquo;t! dare not!&nbsp; I must not.&nbsp; How could I 
dishonour him by bearing myself towards him as to that other . . 
. worthless . . . !&nbsp; Oh! the happy, happy girls, who have 
mothers . . . !&rsquo;&nbsp; All the muscles of her body seemed 
to shrink and collapse, till she was like an inert mass at the 
Silver Lady&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>But the other understood!</p>
<p>&nbsp;After a long, long pause; when Stephen&rsquo;s sobbing 
had died away; when each muscle of her body had become rigid on 
its return to normal calm; the Silver Lady began to talk of other
matters, and conversation became normal.&nbsp; Stephen&rsquo;s 
courage seemed somehow to be restored, and she talked 
brightly.</p>
<p>Before they parted the Silver Lady made a request.&nbsp; She 
said in her natural voice:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Couldst thou bring that gallant man who saved so many 
lives, and to whom the Lord was so good in the restoration of his
sight, to see me?&nbsp; Thou knowest I have made a resolution not
to go forth from this calm place whilst I may remain.&nbsp; But I
should like to see him before he returns to that far North where 
he has done such wonders.&nbsp; He is evidently a man of kind 
heart; perhaps he will not mind coming to see a lonely woman who 
is no longer young.&nbsp; There is much I should like to ask him 
of that land of which nothing was known in my own youth.&nbsp; 
Perhaps he will not mind seeing me alone.&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Stephen&rsquo;s heart beat furiously.&nbsp; She felt suffocating 
with new hope, for what could be but good from Harold&rsquo;s 
meeting with that sweet woman who had already brought so much 
comfort into her own life?&nbsp; She was abashed, and yet 
radiant; she seemed to tread on air as she stood beside her 
friend saying farewell.&nbsp; She did not wish to speak.&nbsp; So
the two women kissed and parted.</p>
<p>It had been arranged that two days hence the Stonehouse party 
were to spend the day at Lannoy, coming before lunch and staying 
the night, as they wanted in the afternoon to return a visit at 
some distance to the north of Lannoy.&nbsp; Harold was to ride 
over with them.</p>
<p>When the Varilands party arrived, Stephen told them of Sister 
Ruth&rsquo;s wish to see Harold.&nbsp; Pearl at once proffered a 
request that she also should be taken at some other time to see 
the Silver Lady.&nbsp; Harold acquiesced heartily; and it was 
agreed that some time in the late afternoon he should pay the 
visit.&nbsp; Stephen would bring him.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, she felt no awkwardness, no trepidation, as 
they rode up the steep road to the Mill.</p>
<p>When the introduction had been effected, and half an hour had 
been consumed in conventional small talk, Stephen, obedience to a
look from the Silver Lady, rose.&nbsp; She said in they most 
natural way she could:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now Sister Ruth, I will leave you two alone, if you do 
not mind.&nbsp; Harold can tell you all you want to know about 
Alaska; and perhaps, if you are very good, he will tell some of 
his adventures!&nbsp; Good afternoon, dear.&nbsp; I wish you were
to be with us to-night; but I know your rule.&nbsp; I go for my 
ride.&nbsp; Sultan has had no exercise for five days; and he 
looked at me quite reproachfully when we met this morning.&nbsp; 
Au revoir, Harold.&nbsp; We shall meet at dinner!&rsquo;</p>
<p>When she had gone Harold came back from the door, and stood in
the window looking east.&nbsp; The Silver Lady came and stood 
beside him.&nbsp; She did not seem to notice his face, but in the
mysterious way of women she watched him keenly.&nbsp; She wished 
to satisfy her own mind before she undertook her self-appointed 
task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Her eyes were turned towards the headland towards which 
Stephen on her white Arab was galloping at breakneck speed.&nbsp;
He was too good a horseman himself, and he knew her prowess on 
horseback too well to have any anxiety regarding such a rider at 
Stephen.&nbsp; It was not fear, then, that made his face so 
white, and his eyes to have such an illimitable sadness.</p>
<p>The Silver Lady made up her mind.&nbsp; All her instincts were
to trust him.&nbsp; She recognised a noble nature, with which 
truth would be her surest force.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;sit here, friend; where 
another friend has often sat with me.&nbsp; From this you can see
all the coastline, and all that thou wilt!&rsquo;&nbsp; Harold 
put a chair beside the one she pointed out; and when she was 
seated he sat also.&nbsp; She began at once with a desperate 
courage:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have wanted much to see thee.&nbsp; I have heard much
of thee, before thy coming.&rsquo;&nbsp; There was something in 
the tone of her voice which arrested his attention, and he looked
keenly at her.&nbsp; Here, in the full light, her face looked 
sadly white and he noticed that her lips trembled.&nbsp; He said 
with all the kindliness of his nature, for from the first moment 
he had seen her he had taken to her, her purity and earnestness 
and sweetness appealing to some aspiration within him:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are pale!&nbsp; I fear you are not well!&nbsp; May 
I call your maid?&nbsp; Can I do anything for you?&rsquo;&nbsp; 
She waved her hand gently:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay!&nbsp; It is nothing.&nbsp; It is but the result of
a sleepless night and much thought.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh!&nbsp; I wish I had known!&nbsp; I could have put 
off my visit; and I could have come any other time to suit 
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; She smiled gently:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear that would have availed but little.&nbsp; It was
of thy coming that I was concerned.&rsquo;&nbsp; Seeing his look 
of amazement, she went on quickly, her voice becoming more steady
as she lost sight of herself in her task:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Be patient a little with me.&nbsp; I am an old woman; 
and until recently it has been many and many years since the calm
which I sought here has been ruffled.&nbsp; I had come to believe
that for me earthly troubles were no more.&nbsp; But there has 
come into my life a new concern.&nbsp; I have heard so much of 
thee, and before thy coming.&rsquo;&nbsp; The recurrence of the 
phrase struck him.&nbsp; He would have asked how such could be, 
but he deemed it better to wait.&nbsp; She went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been wishful to ask thy advice.&nbsp; But why 
should not I tell thee outright that which troubles me?&nbsp; I 
am not used, at least for these many years, to dissemble.&nbsp; I
can but trust thee in all; and lean on thy man&rsquo;s mercy to 
understand, and to aid me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall do all in my power, believe me!&rsquo; said 
Harold simply.&nbsp; &lsquo;Speak freely!&rsquo;&nbsp; She 
pointed out of the window, where Stephen&rsquo;s white horse 
seemed on the mighty sweep of green sward like a little dot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is of her that I would speak to thee!&rsquo;&nbsp; 
Harold&rsquo;s heart began to beat hard; he felt that something 
was coming.&nbsp; The Silver Lady went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why thinkest thou that she rideth at such speed?&nbsp; 
It is her habit!&rsquo;&nbsp; He waited.&nbsp; She continued:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doth it not seem to thee that such reckless movement is
the result of much trouble; that she seeketh 
forgetfulness?&rsquo;&nbsp; He knew that she was speaking truly; 
and somehow the conviction was borne upon him that she knew his 
secret heart, and was appealing to it.&nbsp; If it was about 
Stephen!&nbsp; If her disquiet was about her; then God bless 
her!&nbsp; He would be patient and grateful.&nbsp; The 
Quaker&rsquo;s voice seemed to come through his thought, as 
though she had continued speaking whilst he had paused:</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have all our own secrets.&nbsp; I have had mine; and
I doubt not that thou hast had, may still have, thine own.&nbsp; 
Stephen hath hers!&nbsp; May I speak to thee of her?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I shall be proud!&nbsp; Oh! madam, I thank you with all
my heart for your sweet kindness to her.&nbsp; I cannot say what 
I feel; for she has always been very dear to me!&rsquo;&nbsp; In 
the pause before she spoke again the beating of his own heart 
seemed to re-echo the quick sounds of Stephen&rsquo;s galloping 
horse.&nbsp; He was surprised at the method of her speech when it
did come; for she forgot her Quaker idiom, and spoke in the 
phrasing of her youth:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you love her still?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;With all my soul!&nbsp; More than ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, God be thanked; for it is in your power to do 
much good.&nbsp; To rescue a poor, human, grieving soul from 
despair!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her words conveyed joy greater than she 
knew.&nbsp; Harold did not himself know why the air seemed filled
with sounds that seemed to answer every doubt of his life.&nbsp; 
He felt, understood, with that understanding which is quicker 
than thought.&nbsp; The Silver Lady went on now with a rush:</p>
<p>&lsquo;See, I have trusted you indeed!&nbsp; I have given away
another woman&rsquo;s secret; but I do it without fear.&nbsp; I 
can see that you also are troubled; and when I look back on my 
own life and remember the trouble that sent me out of the world; 
a lonely recluse here in this spot far from the stress of life, I
rejoice that any act of mine can save such another tragedy as my 
own.&nbsp; I see that I need not go into detail.&nbsp; You know 
that I am speaking truth.&nbsp; It was before you came so 
heroically on this new scene that she told me her secret.&nbsp; 
At a time when nothing was known of you except that you had 
disappeared.&nbsp; When she laid bare her poor bleeding heart to 
me, she did it in such wise that for an instant I feared that it 
was a murder which she had committed.&nbsp; Indeed, she called it
so!&nbsp; You understand that I know all your secret; all her 
part in it at least.&nbsp; And I know that you understand what 
loving duty lies before you.&nbsp; I see it in your eyes; your 
brave, true eyes!&nbsp; Go! and the Lord be with 
thee!&rsquo;&nbsp; Her accustomed idiom had returned with 
prayer.&nbsp; She turned her head away, and, standing up, leaned 
against the window.&nbsp; Bending over, he took her hand and said
simply:</p>
<p>&lsquo;God bless you!&nbsp; I shall come back to thank you 
either to-night or to-morrow; and I hope that she will be with 
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went quickly out of the room.&nbsp; The woman stood for 
long looking out of the window, and following with tear-dimmed 
eyes the movement of his great black horse as he swept across 
country straight as the crow flies, towards the headland whither 
Stephen had gone.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Stephen passed over the wide expanse without thought; 
certainly without memory of it.&nbsp; Never in her after-life 
could she recall any thought that had passed through her mind 
from the time she left the open gate of the windmill yard till 
she pulled up her smoking, panting horse beside the ruin of the 
fisher&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Stephen was not unhappy!&nbsp; She was not happy in any 
conscious form.&nbsp; She was satisfied rather than 
dissatisfied.&nbsp; She was a woman!&nbsp; A woman who waited the
coming of a man!</p>
<p>For a while she stood at the edge of the cliff, and looked at 
the turmoil of the tide churning on the rocks below.&nbsp; Her 
heart went out in a great burst of thankfulness that it was her 
hand which had been privileged to aid in rescuing so dear a 
life.&nbsp; Then she looked around her.&nbsp; Ostensibly it was 
to survey the ruined house; but in reality to search, even then 
under her lashes, the whole green expanse sloping up to the 
windmill for some moving figure.&nbsp; She saw that which made 
her throat swell and her ears to hear celestial music.&nbsp; But 
she would not allow herself to think, of that at all 
events.&nbsp; She was all woman now; all-patient, and 
all-submissive.&nbsp; She waited the man; and the man was 
coming!</p>
<p>For a few minutes she walked round the house as though looking
at it critically for some after-purpose.&nbsp; After the wreck 
Stephen had suggested to Trinity House that there should be a 
lighthouse on the point; and offered to bear the expense of 
building it.&nbsp; She was awaiting the answer of the Brethren; 
and of course nothing would be done in clearing the ground for 
any purpose till the answer had come.&nbsp; She felt now that if 
that reply was negative, she would herself build there a 
pleasure-house of her own.</p>
<p>Then she went to the edge of the cliff, and went down the 
zigzag by which the man and horse had gone to their gallant 
task.&nbsp; At the edge of the flat rock she sat and thought.</p>
<p>And through all her thoughts passed the rider who even now was
thundering over the green sward on his way to her.&nbsp; In her 
fancy at first, and later in her ears, she could hear the sound 
of his sweeping gallop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It was thus that a man should come to a woman!</p>
<p>She had no doubts now.&nbsp; Her quietude was a hymn of 
grateful praise!</p>
<p>The sound stopped.&nbsp; With all her ears she listened, her 
heart now beginning to beat furiously.&nbsp; The sea before her, 
all lines and furrows with the passing tide, was dark under the 
shadow of the cliff; and the edge of the shadow was marked with 
the golden hue of sunset.</p>
<p>And then she saw suddenly a pillar of shadow beyond the line 
of the cliff.&nbsp; It rested but a moment, moved swiftly along 
the edge, and then was lost to her eyes.</p>
<p>But to another sense there was greater comfort: she heard the 
clatter of rolling pebbles and the scramble of eager feet.&nbsp; 
Harold was hastening down the zigzag.</p>
<p>Oh! the music of that sound!&nbsp; It woke all the finer 
instincts of the woman.&nbsp; All the dross and thought of self 
passed away.&nbsp; Nature, sweet and simple and true, reigned 
alone.&nbsp; Instinctively she rose and came towards him.&nbsp; 
In the simple nobility of her self-surrender and her purpose, 
which were at one with the grandeur of nature around her, to be 
negative was to be false.</p>
<p>Since he had spoken with the Silver Lady Harold had swept 
through the air; the rush of his foaming horse over the sward had
been but a slow physical progress, which mocked the on-sweep of 
his mind.&nbsp; In is rapid ride he too had been finding 
himself.&nbsp; By the reading of his own soul he knew now that 
love needs a voice; that a man&rsquo;s love, to be welcomed to 
the full, should be dominant and self-believing.</p>
<p>When the two saw each other&rsquo;s eyes there was no need for
words.&nbsp; Harold came close, opening wide his arms, Stephen 
flew to them.</p>
<p>In that divine moment, when their mouths met, both knew that 
their souls were one.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
